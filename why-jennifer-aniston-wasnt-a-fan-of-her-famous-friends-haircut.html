First and foremost, she loved <a href=#>all the friends she made through the show</a>. Most importantly, though, "Friends" is where Aniston found the confidence to grow as an actor. "I started to find my confidence when I was on 'Friends,' for sure," she told&nbsp;InStyle in 2019. "In a way, being on that show was the ultimate trust exercise. There was comfort in numbers there, so we all held each other up. I miss a lot about that time. Having a job that was absolute, pure joy. I miss getting to be with people I love massively and respect beyond words."</p><p dir=ltr>The one thing she doesn't miss, though? That would be the "Rachel" haircut. According to Aniston, it was just too much work. "'The Rachel' was high maintenance," she told <a href=#>Marie Claire</a>. "I'd curse [the stylist] every time I had to blow-dry. It took three brushes — it was like doing surgery!" Aniston was also apparently the only person on the planet who didn't like the look of the 'do. "How do I say this?" she said when speaking to <a href=#>Allure</a> in 2011. "I think it was the ugliest haircut I've ever seen."</p><p dir=ltr>So, there you have it. As the biggest trends of the '90s and early '00s circle back, you might see Aniston rocking a halter top and a denim skirt — but you definitely won't see her with "the Rachel" again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWtpaoF3e9ahsGailaO7qrLEq2SappmowbC6jLCYrKakYq5ussCnZKieXZ2ys3nFmqSoraNis7O1xKebrGWYlrazr9StZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
