Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Merriam Webster</a>, the meaning of telenovela is "a soap opera produced in and televised in or from many Latin American countries."</p><p>Some popular titles include <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Queen of Flow</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All for Love</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">La Reina del Sur</a>, which were all produced in either Central or South America and exclusively star Spanish-speaking actors.</p><p>Jane the Virgin doesn't exactly fit that criterion. You see the series is set in Miami, Fla. but according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeing Stars</a>, most of its filming took place in various locations in and around Los Angeles, Cali.</p><p>Another thing to note is that the series is mostly in English. While Jane's heritage is nodded to at times, she has become very well-acquainted with American culture.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So, Jane the Virgin is basically an Americanized telenovela for white people?</p>‚Äî first of all, bitch, ... (@thejournalista) <a href=#>July 28, 2021</a></figure><p>However, ironically enough, Jane the Virgin is based on the 2002 telenovela by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Juana la Virgen</a> by Perla Far√≠as which originally aired on the now-shuttered Venezuelan television network Radio Caracas Televisi√≥n (RCTV).</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hating on the fake death plot line in Jane the Virgin is crazy considering it‚Äôs literally a nod to telenovelas considering Jane the Virgin was a, walk with me, telenovela</p>‚Äî kaeüê© (@kaelinbby) <a href=#>April 11, 2023</a></figure><p>In Juana la Virgen, actress Daniela Alvarado played Juana P√©rez, a 16-year-old student who accidentally became pregnant by artificial insemination due to a hospital error. Juana la Virgen and Jane the Virgin are very similar in plot but what makes the former a telenovela is its Latin American foundation and style.</p><p>So no, Jane the Virgin is not a real telenovela, but it is an Emmy-nominated American television series that will never be forgotten.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButsCnnGasmJp6t7XRoKCnZZFiwaa4xKemr52clg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
