You just sat with the person all night long, and that was it," Matthew Perry explained.</p><p>The late actor added, "You apologized to the people you were with, but they had to understand you had met somebody special to you, and you were going to talk to that person for the rest of the night. And that’s the way it worked."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the reunion, Lisa Kudrow also admitted that the co-stars, "Stay in touch, maybe not every day.
