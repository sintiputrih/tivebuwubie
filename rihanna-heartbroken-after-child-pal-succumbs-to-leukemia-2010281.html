She was truly an angel on earth."</p><p>Jasmina first captured Rihanna's heart in 2008 after the R&B singer, 21, saw a video made by Jasmina's best friend and her mother in an effort to find the girl a bone-marrow donor. Rihanna — who made a special visit to NYC to see Jasmina last spring — followed up their video with her own video helping to find a donor.</p><p>On Monday, Jasmina, who received a bone-marrow transplant last year, was hospitalized after suffering fevers and shortness of breath. She was later diagnosed with pneumonia. By Wednesday, the girl's health had worsened. At 10:55 p.m. Wednesday, the girl passed away, her mother wrote on the <a href=#>Caring Bridge blog</a> she had set up to keep thousands of well-wishers up to date on the girl's condition.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Singer <strong>Kelly Rowland</strong> — who also grew close to Jasmina — tells <strong>UsMagazine.com</strong> exclusively that when she heard the news, "I was absolutely heartbroken.</p><p>"She was a brave and lovely little girl that captured my heart the moment I met her," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "My heart goes out to her mother and best buddy, Isabelle and KMS- the organization that introduced me to her.
