His younger brother, Terry, was born on January 10, 1970. In the late '80s, the two were attracted to the fast money that came with dealing drugs. They started with selling crack cocaine for $50 and soon were quickly immersed in cocaine, operating out of their home, per <a href=#>Metro Times</a>. By the 1990s the brothers had a growing drug business and expanded to several cities. The Flenorys were making millions.</p><p dir=ltr>According to the Drug Enforcement Agency (<a href=#>DEA</a>), they smuggled drugs through 11 states, with a direct supply chain with traffickers in Mexico. At their Atlanta base alone they moved 2,500 kilos of cocaine every month. In addition, they laundered their drug money; Demetrius got into the music and publishing business and co-founded BMF entertainment in an attempt to go legit. Their widespread drug trade also operated out of Detroit; Columbus, Georgia; St. Louis, Louisville, and three cities in Florida — Miami, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando (via another <a href=#>DEA link</a>).</p><p dir=ltr>With all that money, they were not shy about displaying their wealth. They owned property and vehicles in several states, and pricey jewelry. But a two-year investigation brought them down in late 2005. At one point Demetrius' estimated net worth was $100 million, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. He is expected to be released in 2028.</p><p dir=ltr>Renewed interest in the rise of the Black Mafia Family is all thanks to a new Starz series premiering September 26, titled "BMF" (trailer&nbsp;<a href=#>posted on YouTube</a>).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCCj25namlfnby4edOhnGaanJawrHnMmp2imV2brq61y7Jkm52TlrqmedOhnGacoqq0bsDRmp2foZOgtq%2BzjKSgp5%2BjYrynecOeq6unmal8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
