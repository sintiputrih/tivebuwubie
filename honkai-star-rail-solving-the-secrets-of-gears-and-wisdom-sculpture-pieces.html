Honkai Star Rail: Solving the Secrets of Gears and Wisdom Sculpture Pieces.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Discovering the Star Rail Museum</strong></h2><p>Following the Version 1.1 upgrade, the History and Culture Museum, which is situated in the Administrative District of Belobog, has opened its doors. As a player who has saved the world, you have the privilege of managing the Star Rail Museum in Honkai. Your task is to make it well-known and attract a multitude of new visitors.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Seeking Guidance from Pela</strong></h2><p>Once the mission is unlocked, your first task is to speak with Pela, who can be found in the museum’s reception area. Approach her to initiate a conversation. After speaking with Pela, she will proceed to the Industrial Hall, where you will have a new task awaiting you.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2><strong>Exploring the Industrial Hall</strong></h2><p>From the museum’s lobby, make your way to the Industrial Hall. Look for a quest marker on the ground, indicating Pela’s location. Step on the marker to engage Pela in a conversation. During this interaction, Pela informs you that the empty space in front of you is where the sculpture “Gears and Wisdom” was meant to be displayed. Unfortunately, it was stolen, and the Robot Settlement in the Underworld may hold clues to its whereabouts.</p><h2><strong>Investigating the Broken Robots</strong></h2><p>Upon arriving at the Robot Settlement, your first point of contact is Clara. Speak with her to learn about the issues plaguing the robots in the settlement. Clara requests your assistance in examining the broken robots.</p><p>Once you’ve spoken with Clara, a new objective to investigate the broken robots will be activated. These malfunctioning machines can be found near the Robot Settlement area. Approach the first robot and engage in a battle with it. After defeating the robot, Clara will inspect it and discover an unusual component that was taken from the “Gears and Wisdom” sculpture.</p><h2><strong>Collecting the Sculpture Pieces</strong></h2><p>As you progress, you will encounter more robots that drop additional pieces of the “Gears and Wisdom” sculpture. Keep defeating these robots to gather the necessary components. Your goal is to collect 13 out of 50 pieces.</p><p>Once you’ve acquired enough pieces, you’ll face a special puzzle. The solution to this puzzle is provided below.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportslumo.com/ezoimgfmt/cdn.sportslumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/18011207/Untitled-design-2023-06-18T011-1024x576.jpg></p><h2><strong>Solving the Special Puzzle</strong></h2><p>After successfully completing the puzzle, you may still find yourself short on the required number of sculpture pieces. In such a case, the quest will direct you to seek assistance from Svarog.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2><strong>Seeking Svarog’s Help</strong></h2><p>Head to the upper location and approach Svarog, who can be found standing with two children. As you approach, an interaction will be triggered. The children possess a batch of parts from the museum’s sculpture. Engage in a conversation with Svarog to acquire these missing pieces.</p><h2 id=h-rebuilding-gears-and-wisdom><strong>Rebuilding “Gears and Wisdom”</strong></h2><p>Return to the museum and make your way to the exhibit area of the Industrial Hall, where you initially met Pela. Interact with the quest marker in this area to initiate the process of rebuilding the “Gears and Wisdom” sculpture. This achievement allows the Industrial Hall to be opened to the public, attracting more visitors to the museum. As a reward, you will gain Clara as a hired assistant and receive 50,000x new development funds.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-824 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Congratulations on successfully completing the mission “Opportunity Makes the Thief Part 2” in Honkai Star Rail!
