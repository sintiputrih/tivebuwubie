Nicki Minaj featured on The Joe Budden Podcast on Wednesday, after the heated exchange on Queen Radio. And during the latest episode of the podcast with Joe, Rory, and Mal, Minaj did not mince her words when Mal asked for her opinion on who was the better rapper, Rozay (Ross) or The Game.
Minaj referred explicitly to the time that Rick Ross mentioned her in his Apple of My Eye track from his 2017 album Rather You Than Me."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She brought up the subject of rapper Meek Mill’s probation (Meek Mill was Minaj’s boyfriend at the time when he was involved in a criminal case).</p><p>Minaj told Budden that after the meeting, Ross texted Meek, saying, “Yo, this chick [Minaj] is a keeper.”</p><p>Minaj said she saw the text message with her own eyes and that the message read in full: “This chick is a keeper. She went in a room full of rappers and spoke to Obama, and the first thing out of her mouth was about you and figuring out your probation situation and why you’re still on probation after all these years.”</p><p>According to Minaj, it was strange after texting such a message to Meek that Ross would come out with lyrics disrespecting her.</p><p>By the time Ross’s album was released in 2017, Minaj and Mill’s relationship had ended.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nicki Minaj sends shots at Rick Ross in response to 2017 “Apple of My Eye” line</p><p>“I told Meek I wouldn't trust Nicki,⁰Instead of beefin' with your dog, you just give 'em some distance" <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WGl0QMPkgW</a></p><p>— Complex Ambition (@ComplexAmbition) <a href=#>August 14, 2019</a></p><p>Nicki Minaj also referenced Rozay’s recent dissing of 50 Cent during the tour for his new album Port of Miami 2.
