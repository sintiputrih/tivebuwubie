 Reports of the accident that claimed the life of Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez came as Lopes’ grieving family made final preparations for her funeral.
 Lopes was a passenger in a Mitsubishi driven by her personal assistant near the Reyes Caballero neighborhood on April 6 when the boy suddenly stepped off the median, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported yesterday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s the reason the family pressed no charges.”</p><p>The family never even knew Lopes was famous until after her death, the boy’s grandmother told The Post last night.</p><p>“We didn’t realize she was someone famous. She was a normal person,” Berta Martinez said.</p><p>“At the time, we weren’t worried about who she was.
