He graduated from King’s College, a high school in the Auckland area.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28945 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/K.J.-Apa-photo.jpg alt="K.J.

Apa’s photo when he was some years younger. Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=KJ_Apa_8211_Net_Worth_2024>K.J. Apa – Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>No doubt, famous actor KJ Apa would earn a very good amount of money. However, he hаѕ еаrnеd hіѕ mоnеу mајоrlу bу асtіng, аlthоugh hе аlѕо hаѕ hіѕ ѕіdе huѕtlеѕ. Іn 2018 hе lаndеd аn еndоrѕеmеnt dеаl wіth fоѕѕіl in а саmраіgn fоr thе Fоѕѕіl Q Gеn 4 Ѕmаrtwаtсh. Previously, his net worth was $3 million but as of now, it is estimated that Kj Apa has a <strong>net worth</strong> of $4 million.</p><h2><span id=Dating_History>Dating History</span></h2><p>K.J. Apa has been in multiple on-screen matchups, including Ashleigh Murray in Riverdale (2017), Amandla Stenberg in The Hate U Give(2018), Britt Robertson in A Dog’s Purpose (2017), Camila Mendes in Riverdale (2017), and Hayley Law in Riverdale (2017).</p><h4>Britt Robertson</h4><p>KJ Apa first met Britt Robertson on the set of ‘A Dog’s Purpose’ in 2017, which was his first acting gig away from home and his first feature film. The two have recently reunited as costars on the upcoming film I Still Believe, which is set to hit theaters in 2020. It seems as if the second time’s the charm between these two, who were rumored to be an item as of Summer 2019.</p><p>KJ was spotted at Entertainment Weekly’s Comic-Con party in July holding hands and sharing a kiss with Britt. They were also reportedly hanging out with KJ’s Riverdale costars throughout the night. Neither actor has confirmed the romance, but according to Us Weekly, a source has confirmed that they are dating. Either way, their Comic-Con PDA has fans talking.</p><h4>Corinne Isherwood</h4><p>Fans of Riverdale uncovered the identity of a girl they thought was dating KJ Apa in 2018. Apa was briefly linked to Corrine Isherwood, who is a Canadian model. Corrine was 16 years old and KJ was 20 at the time. In addition, Hollyscoop reported that they were linked beginning in November 2017.</p><p>The two were photographed jetting off to New Zealand together and enjoying time with family and friends on numerous occasions. Since KJ films Riverdale in Canada, it’s not so far-fetched to think that the duo’s paths would’ve crossed at some point, but neither one has ever confirmed the romance rumors.</p><p>In an interview with Seventeen, he previously said that he was open to finding love when the stars align: “The thing is, I don’t think it matters whether you’re looking for a relationship or not —it’s not for us to decide when we meet the love of our lives.” He also told Cosmopolitan: “I think I’m just waiting for the right time, right girl. I’m pretty busy at the moment. I don’t know how much I have to offer to someone right now.” It looks like he might have found the one.</p><h4>Clara Berry</h4><p>Currently, he began a relationship with Clara Berry in 2020. Clara is a famous model from France. They seem to have a great bond together. They are having a good and quality time at the moment.</p><p>He posted an Instagram of himself kissing a seemingly unknown girl. That photo makes it hard to identify the woman because her face is hidden. Apa’s Instagram photo is captioned “coupe de foudre” which translates in English to “love at first sight.”</p><p>Surprisingly, the post came to many who previously believed a romance was beginning between Apa and his “I Still Believe” costar Britt Robertson, MTV reported. Moreover, Apa and Robertson never confirmed or denied their relationship, and it appears the actor has found his true love in Berry. His fans thought Berry and Apa had some sort of relationship back in December when they were liking and commenting on each other’s Instagram photos. So far, he has not gotten into any controversies.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-28944 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/K.J.-Apa-insta-post.jpg alt="K.J. Apa" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-28944 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: K.J. Apa’s Instagram post kissing his current girlfriend, Clara Berry. Source: Instagram</p><h2><span id=Career_and_Professional_Life>Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>At the age of fourteen, KJ recorded a solo guitar album. His acting career took off almost immediately after he began pursuing it. Soon, in 2013, with virtually no acting experience, he earned the dark role of suicidal teen Kane Jenkins in New Zealand’s longest-running primetime soap opera, Shortland Street, while still in high school.</p><p>Further, Apa played Kane for two seasons but had to cut his storyline short when Hollywood came calling. He nabbed the lead role on The CW’s Riverdale. But winning the role wasn’t without its obstacles. It took producers of the series an arduous six months, wading through countless redheads throughout the Los Angeles area, to find their leading man, and they found him at the last minute.</p><p>Furthermore, Apa admitted his first audition was lackluster, his over 12-hour plane ride from New Zealand not helping his odds. After being called back for a second audition, he found his stride and allowed his musical talents to shine.</p><h4>More</h4><p>“K.J. Apa read for us and he was immediately Archie Andrews,” series official producer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa told Vulture in 2017. “It was the right combination of earnestness and edge. And he played the guitar like a dream.” Playing a rendition of Stevie Ray Vaughan’s “Mary Had a Little Lamb” on his electric guitar for casting directors, Apa was more in his element.</p><p>“There were a couple of Southern people in the theater so I brought my guitar,” Apa recalled with a laugh. “I felt confident after I played that song because music comes really naturally to me and it’s always something I’ve been passionate about.” Apa’s combination of boyish good looks and early experience playing a dark character made him the perfect leading man for Riverdale.</p><h4>More about his Career</h4><p>Along with the characters Betty (Lili Reinhart), Veronica (Camila Mendes), and Jughead (Cole Sprouse), Apa’s casting made the series complete. Premiering in 2017, the movie ‘Riverdale’ won positive reviews and became a hit for the network across multiple seasons.</p><p>Moreover, his fast fame as Archie led to additional opportunities on the big screen, including the comedy-drama A Dog’s Purpose (2017), the crime drama The Hate You Give (2018), and the rom-com The Last Summer (2019). He then took on the starring role of Jeremy Camp in I Still Believe (2020), about the Christian singer-songwriter’s romance with a young woman dying from ovarian cancer.</p><h2><span id=Brand_Endorsements>Brand Endorsements</span></h2><p>K.J. Apa is also famous for his brand endorsement activities. He is the brand ambassador for the popular brand, Lacoste.
