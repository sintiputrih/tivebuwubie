That character is done.”</p><p>Harry appeared as Sandra Clark in the NBC sitcom about the lives of women in a predominantly Black apartment building in 1950s Washington D.C. 227, which ran from 1985 to 1990, earned Harry a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 1987. The series also starred <strong>Marla Gibbs</strong>,<strong> Hal Williams</strong>, <strong>Alaina Reed Hall</strong>,<strong> Regina King</strong>,<strong> Kia Goodwin</strong> and <strong>Helen Martin</strong>.</p><p>Although Harry may not be into the idea of a 227 reboot, she does still cherish her time on the show — especially her relationships with other cast members.</p><p>“Besides one Emmy for [227], one of my favorite things was meeting Regina King because she’s one of my greatest friends,” she shared with Us. “It’s something that I know to happen, to have a real relationship with a person you work with and having that whole experience of the ’80s: living well, many husbands and a great positive tone.”</p><p>Aside from King, 53, Harry also still talks to Gibbs, 92 — who still manages to go out to clubs despite her age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jackee-Harry-Explains-Why-She-Would-Not-Do-a-227-Reboot-Cast.jpg><p>“She calls me at 3 o’clock in the morning … ‘Hey, what you doing?’ [She] says, ‘I’m going to be at the so-and-so [club]. You gonna be there?’” Harry explained, adding that Gibbs will go out around 11 p.m. “I’m serious.”</p><p>Since ending 227 in 1990, Harry has moved on to several other projects, including Days of Our Lives, which she has starred in since 2021.</p><p>The long-running soap opera, which has been airing on NBC since 1965, was nominated for 11 awards at the 51st Annual Emmys including Best Daytime Drama Series, <strong>Tamara Braun</strong> for Best Lead Actress Performance in a Daytime Drama Series, <strong>Eric Martsolf</strong> for Best Lead Actor Performance in a Daytime Drama Series and <strong>Dick Van Dyke</strong> for Best Guest Performance in a Daytime Drama Series.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although Days of Our Lives was beat out in several categories, Van Dyke, 98, <a href=#>took home the Emmy award</a> for his role of Timothy Robicheaux — and became the oldest Daytime Emmy winner.</p><p>“Thank you. I don’t believe this. I feel like a spy from nighttime television,” he shared in his acceptance speech on Friday. “I’m the oldest nominee in history. I’ve been playing old men all my life. If I’d known I was going to live this long I’d have taken better care of myself.”</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Jones</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGam5uasm60wKupsmWimsOmrcusZLCgqWLAqbGMsKanrF2Xsm6wzqKloGWRYn9zg4yrnJunn6l8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
