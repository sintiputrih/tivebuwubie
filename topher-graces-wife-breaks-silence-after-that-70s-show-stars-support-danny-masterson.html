I see you."&nbsp;</p><p id=ejxL58Y-yw data-wc=45>"Topher Grace's wife. Finally someone with some sensibility," opined one fan on X, formerly known as Twitter, as another added: "Topher Grace’s wife (Ashley Hinshaw) actually showing her support to victims is so much better than just staying silent like 99% of Hollywood does lol."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/abd90edd4154-3760558801678428062931162649840959021681731n.jpg><p id=eaJDFJaTPx data-wc=59>The decision to speak out also comes as the way Topher has been portrayed is being reexamined in the wake of Danny's sentencing. That 70s Show ran for eight years between 1998 and 2006, and focused on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in the fictional town of Point Place, Wisconsin in the late 1970s.&nbsp;</p><p id=eM9rfNwwEPL data-wc=14>Topher,<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;Mila Kunis,</a> <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Ashton Kutcher,&nbsp;</a>Laura Prepon, and <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Wilmer Valderrama all starred alongside Danny.&nbsp;</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8013890b4113-gettyimages-635761813.jpg><p id=eMGA5s0sMe data-wc=33>At the time it was well-documented that Topher did not spend time with the rest of the cast when the cameras stopped rolling, something some saw in a negative light at the time.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeH6YYSHpd data-wc=58>Now, however, fans have been reconsidering the details, with one writing on X, formerly known as Twitter: "Topher Grace.....was depicted as being a loner who didn't socialize with the 70's Show cast. <strong>Good for him. He went on to have an actual career and now isn't caught up in Danny Masterson's rape conviction mess. Match, set &nbsp;point Topher."&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e6ZXEMzp0C data-wc=40>"I have a newfound respect for Topher Grace," added another. "After years of hearing him being called 'entitled' or a 'diva' I wonder now if it was all because he didn't like Danny Masterson and the rest of the cast."</p><p id=ea5kOlxrwTD data-wc=49>Topher's former co-stars <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Ashton and Mila wrote letters in support&nbsp;</a>of Danny to sway the judge when it came to sentencing after he was found guilty of two rape charges; they later<a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>&nbsp;posted a video on Instagram apologizing for the "pain that has been caused"</a> after their letters emerged.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/62a188bcfcee-gettyimages-1465638448.jpg><p id=evJ479spym_ data-wc=15>Debra Jo Rupp and Kurtwood Smith also wrote letters.

The actor was convicted on two of three forcible rape charges in May 2023.

The jury convicted him of the rape of two women but did not reach a verdict on an allegation from November 2001 involving a former girlfriend.&nbsp;</p><p id=e6zMkQ4aNU data-wc=45>“Mr. Masterson, you are not the victim here. Your actions 20 years ago took away another person’s voice and choice. Your actions 20 years ago were criminal, and that is why you are here,” Judge Charlaine Olmedo said in the courtroom on Thursday September 7.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/43d649f1883d-gettyimages-2791777.jpg><p id=eqwZ0SDFy7 data-wc=88>In a letter sent to Judge Olmedo, Ashton wrote: "While I’m aware that the judgement has been cast as guilty on two counts of rape by force and the victims have a great desire for justice, I hope that my testament to his character is taken into consideration in sentencing. I do not believe he is an ongoing harm to society and having his daughter raised without a present father would be a tertiary injustice in and of itself. Thank you for taking the time to read this."&nbsp;</p><p id=ep6voru-En data-wc=61>Part of Mila's letter to the judge read: <strong>“Danny has consistently displayed a profound sense of responsibility and care for those around him</strong>. He demonstrates grace and empathy in every situation, be it within the entertainment industry or in our personal lives. His steady support and understanding presence make him a reliable source of guidance and comfort for all of us."&nbsp;</p><p id=e6IVYl9BeFw data-wc=31><strong>Get the lowdown on the biggest, hottest celebrity news, features and profiles coming out of the U.S. <a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our HELLO!
