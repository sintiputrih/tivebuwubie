In addition to acting, the young adult is an accomplished author who knows a thing or two about clapping back on social media. In 2019, she released her book, Reach for the Skai: How to Inspire, Empower, and Clapback. During an interview with&nbsp;<a href=#>ET</a>&nbsp;for their&nbsp;Unfiltered&nbsp;series,&nbsp;Skai spoke about the price that comes with fame.</p><p>&nbsp;She said, ‚ÄúFor me, growing up at a young age in the limelight and on social media, I joined Twitter when I was 10 and I got my Instagram when I was 11, so when I joined Instagram, I did notice a lot of hate comments or people would just, like, nitpick at my appearance, just to be funny.‚Äù</p><p>She continued, ‚ÄúA lot of people go through this. The most popular people do. And for me, being a young age, I didn‚Äôt understand why these people were saying these things. I would get really, really sad. But now I‚Äôm starting to learn to love myself no matter what and not care what anyone says.‚Äù</p><p>We hope these two can become friends again one day!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiak6C8r7jIp5xnm5%2BifHN8kWpmaWlfZoNwtdJmqqikkaO0pr%2BMrKanZZqquabGjKykoqyYYrGiwMinnmarm5a2brbAnKKsp55k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
