The series has been on the air for a decade, but thanks to the the ever-changing dynamics in Hope Valley, there’s still plenty of story to be told. As Monsters and Critics reported, the Hallmark hit returns Sunday, April 7 at 8/7c.
The romantic drama will pivot like never before, with Elizabeth (Erin Krakow) and Lucas’ (Chris McNally) romance buried."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If many people do flee the show, there’s a chance Hallmark will consider wrapping it up sooner than planned.</p><p>We can only await new episodes to see how this shakes out.</p><p>But for now, we’re cautiously optimistic the series will be able to right some of the wrongs of When Calls the Heart Season 10.</p><p>When Calls the Heart is currently on hiatus, but Season 11 is set to premiere on Hallmark on Sunday, April 7, at 8/7c.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWivmJq7bq%2FApaOsZaSdsm60xJqprWWjmq60u81maGploKeyrrXEq5xmnJGpsm66xLCqZp%2BVqcBuucixnJ1lopqupMDIqKVmnqKkum6ywKeqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
