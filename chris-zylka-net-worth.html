His career has been active since 2008.</p><p>So, have you ever wondered how rich Chris Zylka is, as of early 2018? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that the total size of Chris’ net worth is over $4 million, accumulated through his successful involvement in the entertainment industry.</p><h3><strong>Chris Zylka Net Worth $4 Million</strong></h3><p>Chris Zylka spent his childhood in his hometown, where he was raised by his parents. Upon matriculation from Howland High School in 2003, he enrolled in the University of Toledo, but there is no record of him graduating.</p><p>Prior to his acting career, Chris worked as a fashion model, who collaborated with such brands as Diesel Jeans and Calvin Klein. He was also on the cover of several magazines, including VMan, Bello, Homme Essential and Glamoholic, among others, all of which marked the establishment of his net worth.</p><p>Speaking about Chris’ career as an actor, it began in 2008, when he guest-starred in the TV series “Everybody Hates Chris”, which was followed by another guest-starring appearance in the TV series “90210”. His breakthrough came in 2009, when he featured in the role of Brigg in the TV film “My Super Psycho Sweet 16”, which he later reprised in its spin-off “My Super Psycho Sweet 16: Part 2” (2010). During the same year, he was chosen to play Joey Donner in the TV series entitled “10 Things I Hate About You” (2009-2010), after which he portrayed Thor in the film “Kaboom” (2010), directed by Gregg Araki.
