Of course, she was most memorable, in fans' estimations, in the film 'Mean Girls,' a legacy that still follows the actress today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But unlike many other actresses from her era, Amanda has seen continued success ever since 1999, when she earned a role on 'As the World Turns.' The true test, of course, of Seyfried's staying power is essentially, how much is she worth today?</p><p>While Seyfried has had plenty of lucrative roles, she's also passed on a few potentially career-propelling opportunities, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including one gig on 'Guardians of the Galaxy.'</a>&nbsp;That makes it sound like she's living pretty comfortably on her current earnings, doesn't it?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which MCU Character Did Amanda Seyfried Turn Down?</a></span></p><p>The fact is, Amanda probably doesn't&nbsp;need the money from the MCU. Her resume is pretty long without it, she's still a household name despite 'Mean Girls' premiering more than 15 years ago, and she's got no shortage of upcoming projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two of her films are currently in post-production, and Seyfried also had three film credits in 2020 alone. It's not surprising, though; the actress has been working hard, and raking in the dough.</p><p>She's worth at least $12 million, says&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, which is definitely a respectable amount for a '90s star who's somehow managed to remain relevant as the Hollywood landscape has changed.</p><p>She has evolved a lot with the times, too. Starting out on a '90s soap opera before moving on to film and then back to TV for numerous appearances, Seyfried is clearly not a one-hit wonder. The fact that she was in demand enough to get an MCU offer probably tells half of the story.</p><p>But the actress also has a good head on her shoulders. She skipped the chance to attend college in New York City, says&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, to act in 'Mean Girls' instead. That intuition made her bank, and follow-ups to that hit earned millions at the box office. Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">there's one film she's eager to re-do</a>, if the opportunity presents itself, she's had a diverse journey in Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Seyfried's resume also includes movies like 'Mamma Mia!' and its sequel, a film with Channing Tatum ('Dear John'), and a co-starring role with Justin Timberlake ('In Time').</p><p>She's put the cash to good use, too.&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth points out that Amanda spent $1.85 on a mansion previously owned by Adam Brody (her 'Jennifer's Body' co-star), and she also owned a condo in NYC that she bought in 2010 for $1.7 million.</p><p>She seems pretty smart about money, and with continued movie projects adding even more length to her resume, Amanda can probably expect her net worth to rise, too.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Mank' Star Amanda Seyfried On The Legacy Of 'Modern' Hollywood Diva Marion Davies</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYppmema5uv8SynauhlZl6r7HTZq6oqqSdfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
