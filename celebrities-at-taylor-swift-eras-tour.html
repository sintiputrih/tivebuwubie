Those who are fans of the <a href=#>woman with a $1+ billion net worth</a> knew how difficult it was to secure a ticket, especially with the <a href=#>scandal from Ticketmaster who sold the tickets for the Eras Tour</a>, making it even harder still to get a seat.</p><p>Add in the prices that after-market ticket brokers were charging for tickets, which in some cases <a href=#>turned out to be fraudulent tickets for the Eras Tour</a>, it seemed like a near-impossible feat to be one of the lucky few to see Swift live in concert.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-4-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Diet And Training For The Eras Tour Wasn't Perfect, According To A Fitness Expert ">Taylor Swift's Diet And Training For The Eras Tour Wasn't Perfect, According To A Fitness Expert</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's health and fitness journey hasn't always been the smoothest.</p><p>Even celebrities were not immune to issues with tickets. However, their situation was slightly different. This is because there were a select number of celebrities who were allowed in the VIP tent for the evening. Despite Taylor Swift's Eras Tour attracting many celebrities, not all of them got VIP treatment. Those who wanted to see Swift in action either had to pay for a box seat or, for some, sit among the fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are those fans whose status was not enough to warrant VIP.</p><h2 id=karlie-kloss-didn-39-t-have-a-vip-ticket-to-eras>Karlie Kloss Didn't Have A VIP Ticket To Eras</h2><h3 id=karlie-kloss-sat-in-the-upper-portion-of-the-stadium-with-fans>Karlie Kloss sat in the upper portion of the stadium with fans</h3><p>Karlie Kloss and Swift met after Swift performed at a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show. The two got along well and became fast friends.</p><p>In the months that followed after their friendship began, Kloss became part of Swift's squad, which also included <strong><a href=#>Gigi Hadid</a></strong>, <a href=#><strong>Selena Gomez</strong></a>, Martha Hunt, and more. Kloss even appeared in Swift's "Bad Blood" video. It looked like there was nothing that could come between the two friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/instar53648359-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Kloss and Swift have never publicly spoken about their friendship, or lack of it, many speculate that it began to strain after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kloss went on a vacation with Scooter Braun at the height of the feud with Swift</a> over purchasing her master tracks. Some fans even believe that the song, "It's Time to Go" is about Kloss.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1-37.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift Slams Ex-Boyfriends And Fellow Celebrities In An Album That's Wonderfully Petty">Taylor Swift Slams Ex-Boyfriends And Fellow Celebrities In An Album That's Wonderfully Petty</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift is more than fine to diss her ex-boyfriends and some of the biggest celebrities in the world in her new album.</p><p>If there is a rift between the two, it would make sense that Kloss would not have been invited to the VIP Tent for the Eras Tour. However, not only was Kloss not invited to the tent, she sat in the stands with fans for the three-and-a-half-hour event.</p><h2 id=meghan-markle-sat-in-stadium-seating-instead-of-a-vip-slot>Meghan Markle Sat In Stadium Seating Instead Of A VIP Slot</h2><h3 id=meghan-markle-sat-in-the-stadium-seats-rather-than-in-the-vip-tent>Meghan Markle sat in the stadium seats rather than in the VIP Tent</h3><p><strong><a href=#>Meghan Markle</a></strong> and friends attended the Eras Tour. However, they were not spotted by fans in the VIP area or even in a box seat. Instead, Markle and her friends sat among the plebian Swifties and sang along to the songs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/meghan-markle-attends-taylor-swift-s-eras-tour-without-prince-harry-fuelling-divorce-speculation.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is unclear what the relationship between Markle and Swift is. The duchess <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reached out to Swift to have her appear on Markle's now-defunct podcast</a>, Archietypes. According to sources, Markle not only had Swift's people contacted but wrote a "handwritten letter" to the Midnights singer as well.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kim-kardashian-and-taylor-swift.jpeg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kim Kardashian Bullied Online By Swifties As Fans Are Convinced Taylor Swift Disses Her In New Songs">Kim Kardashian Bullied Online By Swifties As Fans Are Convinced Taylor Swift Disses Her In New Songs</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans were quick to troll Kim with the release of Taylor's new album, but she's not the only person referenced in the lyrics.</p><p>Unfortunately, Swift's schedule would not allow her to appear on the podcast, which would have been a coup for Markle. However, it does not appear to have soured how Markle feels about Swift, given her appearance at the concert.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-skipped-the-vip-treatment-too>Sydney Sweeney Skipped The VIP Treatment, Too</h2><h3 id=sydney-sweeney-sat-in-box-seats-at-the-eras-tour>Sydney Sweeney sat in box seats at the Eras Tour</h3><p>While <strong><a href=#>Sydney Sweeney</a></strong> and Swift may not be friends, many have compared the two and like to draw parallels to how similar Sweeney and Swift are. The most popular similarity that is commented on is how down-to-earth they both are. With the throng of celebrities who came out for the Eras Tour, it was not surprising for Sweeney to appear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sydney-sweeney-vanity-fair-oscar-party-1.jpg><p>Clearly a fan of Swift's music, Sweeney posted pictures and videos from her night at the final performance at SoFi Stadium. From her box seat, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sweeney danced and sang along with friends</a>, looking like she had an amazing time.</p><p>While she was in the VIP Tent, it did not appear to have phased Sweeney one bit, who captioned her Instagram carousel of pictures, "Had the time of my life."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=machine-gun-kelly-might-have-bought-his-own-eras-tour-ticket>Machine Gun Kelly Might Have Bought His Own Eras Tour Ticket</h2><h3 id=machine-gun-kelly-sat-in-box-seats-at-the-eras-tour>Machine Gun Kelly sat in box seats at the Eras Tour</h3><p>One celebrity that some were surprised to see at the Eras Tour was Machine Gun Kelly. However, this should not be that astounding, given that it appears that Swift and Machine Gun Kelly and <strong><a href=#>Megan Fox</a></strong> are friendly with one another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/machine-gun-kelly.jpg><p>This was proven at the Super Bowl after party <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where pictures were taken of Swift, Travis Kelce, Fox, and MGK</a> chatting and hanging out with each other. When this friendship began is unclear. But the conversation was more than just passing, proving there is some sort of history there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is not clear if Megan Fox attended the Eras Tour. While she was not spotted in videos or pictures fans took of Machine Gun Kelly while he attended a SoFi Stadium show, that does not mean Fox was not in attendance. However, if she was, she was enjoying the view with Machine Gun Kelly from a box seat rather than from the VIP Tent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmaZpGLBosXLqKlmq6ees7V5xKuYrGWkpMKzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
