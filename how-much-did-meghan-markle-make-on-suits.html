Markle left the show after its 7th season, just in time for her royal wedding in May 2018. Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meghan is back with a $100 million Netflix deal</a>, fans continue to wonder how much she made during her 'Suits' days.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Are Meghan Markle's Celebrity Friends?</a></span></p><h2 id=meghan-markle-suits-salary>Meghan Markle "Suits" Salary</h2><p>Meghan Markle is truly living out most of our dreams! The Los Angeles-born actress gained prominence in 2011 after joining the cast of the hit USA Network show 'Suits', alongside cast members Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, and Sarah Rafferty. Markle had landed countless television and film roles prior to landing the role of Rachel Zane, and her paralegal character instantly became a fan favorite.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While she is set up in her $14.65 million Montecito, California home with hubby, Prince Harry, who wishes to go by just Harry moving forward, she made most of her net worth on the show. According to a number of sources, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Meghan Markle managed to bring in $450,000 annually</a> as an actress on 'Suits'. The star appeared on the show starting in 2011 and left after its 7th season. With over 100 episodes and 7 seasons, it is estimated that Markle made anywhere between $3.5 to $5 million during her time on the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Meghan Markle And Prince Harry Plus Other Celebrities Who Met On A Blind Date</a></span></p><p>The actress later moved to the United Kingdom with Harry after marrying in May 2018. While their time as members of the royal family came to an end this year, the duo are looking forward to getting their lives started in Los Angeles. In August, it was announced that Meghan and Harry had landed a deal with Netflix! Considering Meghan's experience in Hollywood and Harry's yearning to be involved in film production, this was an easy decision for the two, and one that will make them a lot of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is reported that Quibi had extended an offer to Markle in the "tens of millions", however Netflix swooped in and made them an offer they simply could not refuse. The dynamic duo is now making what was revealed to be over&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million all thanks to the deal they signed with the streaming platform</a>. Their new venture into the entertainment industry is making it clear that these two will be just fine without any royal&nbsp;money, which is exactly what they had hoped for.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Meghan Markle And Prince Harry's Wedding: Details We Forgot About</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lnZq0qa3NZqSaqpuhsm65wKScZqeeYsC2tdOsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
