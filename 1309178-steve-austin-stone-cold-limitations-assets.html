When arrived to WCW in the early 1990s, he dawned the nickname of “Stunning” Steve. A classy technician in the ring, “Stunning” Steve often entered the squared circle with a signature robe.

Often adorned with feathers and jewels, Austin modeled inspiration after “The Nature Boy” Ric Flair. Flair would became synonymous with the grand robes in professional wrestling. In 1996, the rise of “Stone Cold” emerged at the forefront of the WWF. Austin would build his legacy of middle fingers, defiant attitude, and many cans of whoopass.</p><p>When speaking with <a href=#>Sportskeeda Wrestling</a>, Steve Austin revealed his honest thoughts on a possible match between the two versions of himself.</p><p>“Stunning Steve Austin would not stand a chance,” he said candidly. “He was somewhat of a technician. A lot of people do this to try to model their career after someone else. I was trying to model my career at that time to ‘Nature Boy’ Ric Flair, because I thought he was the greatest thing going. [And] the way he traveled all over the world defending the world championship. I was modeling my game after “The Nature Boy”. [But] there’s never going to be another one of him.”</p><p>“I turned into Stone Cold due to some physical limitations, but I made limitations into assets. And [I] developed the attitude and the persona and the show biz part of it, and the swagger and the attitude,” Austin noted. “Maybe I helped usher in attitude along with several other people.”</p><p>“As great as an athlete is “Stunning” Steve was, the experience factor and the mean streak of Stone Cold, he would have crushed Stunning Steve,” Austin proclaimed.</p><p>In conclusion, “Stone Cold” would definitely defeat “Stunning” Steve Austin…and that’s the bottom line, because Stone Cold said so!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJpcGpvaGLAtbHVnmSaraOptq950q2mp51dmLytsIyloKahpJbBqrvNrGSaq6OawbQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
