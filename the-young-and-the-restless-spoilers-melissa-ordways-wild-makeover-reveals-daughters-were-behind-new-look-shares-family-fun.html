Y&R fans know Melissa Ordway is always camera-ready for her role as Abby Newman in Genoa City. However, Ordway’s real-life role of Mom led to a brand-new look thanks to Ordway’s young daughters, Olivia and Sophie.</p><p>In an Instagram story, Ordway posted a pic of herself with smeared, heavy makeup. It’s clear that Ordway’s daughters made some bold, artistic choices! Ordway admitted Sophie and Olivia were behind this wild makeover in the caption. “The girls just did my makeup…I’m feeling this new look,” Ordway said.</p><p>While production is suspended at The Young and the Restless, Ordway’s been taking this time to bond with her family and make some sweet memories. Olivia and Sophie undoubtedly had a blast doing their mom’s makeup, which is what this extra time together is all about.</p><p>Throughout the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> <strong>COVID-19</strong></a> aka coronavirus crisis, Ordway has been posting great family photos and giving everyone updates on their activities. It’s clear that Ordway and her husband, Justin Gaston, are doing everything they can to make sure their girls enjoy themselves.</p><p>From trips to the beach and dance parties to doughnut-making and playing dress-up, Ordway’s got this family fun thing down pat! We’ll pass along more news from Ordway and her fellow cast members, who are also trying to fill the time until they can all get back to work.</p><p>Speaking of work, what’s next for Abby once Y&R resumes production? The Young and the Restless spoilers say Abby may have to deal with a little more Phyllis Summers (Michelle Stafford) drama, which she should be used to by now! Let’s hope the show can resolve their feud and allow Abby to move on eventually.</p><p>As for Abby’s relationship with Chance Chancellor (Donny Boaz), it may be due for a shakeup as well. Chance and Abby’s romance has been moving along nicely, but there’ll inevitably be some bumps in the road at some point. There should be some curveballs headed their way, so we’ll all be eager to see what’s in store.</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers say some exciting things are ahead on the CBS soap, so stay tuned.
