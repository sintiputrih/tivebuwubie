Then the fight started between them, grabbing each other. The producers broke up the fight, and Monique told other girls that she would kill her. After that, they stopped talking with each other.</span></p><p><span>"Right now, the relationship is nonexistent," she said. "I do not talk to her. Yes, it was a terrible situation, but it also helped me to grow as a person, recognizing what my attributes are and just ensuring something like that will never happen again."</span></p><p><span>It seemed that Monique is existing ROHP.

It’s not easy doing reality TV, and to be quite honest, I’m over it. I appreciate everything that people have done for me, everybody that's been Team Monique — I love y'all, I thank y'all — but when you cross certain lines there's no going back. And for me, my family is that line. The opinion of my family and my kids and what they think about anything that I do is more valuable than anybody’s opinion, so I’m over it."</strong></span></p><p><span>But in September 2020, Monique said that she was not going anywhere; while she's not proud of her fall out with Candiace, it wouldn't drive her from the show. She confirmed that she wouldn't leave the show unless she were asked to leave by Bravo.</span></p><p><span>She also said that;</span></p><p><span><strong>"I just kind of take it season by season. If I have the green light to move forward, and if me and my family are still comfortable and we feel like we want to keep sharing our story as a family unit."</strong></span></p><p><span>She revealed that every year she and her husband discuss her time on the show. If they ever feel it's too much for them or their children, then her time on&nbsp;RHOP&nbsp;will have reached its end.</span></p><h2><span><strong>What Is The Net Worth Of Monique Samuels?</strong></span></h2><p><span>American reality television personality Monique has an estimated <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a> of $4 million.</span></p><p><span>Samuels is best known for starring on the reality television series The Real Housewives of Potomac on Bravo since 2016.</span></p><p><span>Monique has bought a new Potomac house in 2016, which was renovated with&nbsp;six-bedroom, eight-bathroom space, changing the wallpaper, window treatments, light fixtures, flooring, the backyard, and turning a library into a playroom for her children, Christopher and Milani.</span></p><p><span>She has been a manager for her husband's real estate investment company.

I'm telling you, I found a diamond in the rough. He's such a lovable person. He's like a big teddy bear, and I love that he has such a respect for our marriage and for me and the kids. And he's such a protector. He just wants to make sure that we're happy and that we always have what we need. And he rarely tells me no. It's always just like, 'You know what, baby, it's all about you. I just want you to be happy.' And I do the same for him. And that's why I bust my butt to make sure he's comfortable. I don't even want him picking up a piece of mail. I'm just like, 'I got you. Sit back, let me rub your feet.''</strong></span></p><p><span>Monique is deeply in love with her husband.&nbsp;She shared a post on Twitter on 24 August 2020:&nbsp;</span><strong>'I just need a little effort while I’m handling everything else (as I pat myself on my back).'</strong></p><p><span>She also added another tweet on the same day saying that;</span></p><p><span><strong>"I know I can’t be the only one who has a husband who thinks pouring the wine is enough. PURSUE ME!! Plan a date and hunt me like you used to!
