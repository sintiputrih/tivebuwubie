She wrote, "Filming Curb Appeal Xtreme for @hgtv is an experience of a lifetime. I remember binge-watching HGTV 20 years ago, wondering how all those designers got to do what they love for a living AND on TV. Turns out, it takes a lot of hard work, bravery, sacrifice, and a stomach to take big risks...and dreaming to the extreme! My grandma used to say, be careful what you ask for, you just might get it. I got it."&nbsp;</p><p>'Curb Appeal Xtreme' premieres on September 8 on HGTV.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom6Wnr26tz6mcmqRdrcGzscyeZKGfpKt6r7HWZqqhp6dis7a4y2aamqukYrmqv9NmoaignmK0qrDDoqWgZaKWsKmxy2armrGcpL9utsCmoJ5llKq%2FqrGMqKytnJ%2Bkv7Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
