Our under-eye area refuses to be our friend. We treat it so nicely. We pat it delicately with creams, let it relax under eye masks and roll over it so gently with our cooling jade roller. But still, we can’t win. It puffs up, blackens with fatigue and eats up our concealer like a lion after its prey."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We pat it delicately with creams, let it relax under eye masks and roll over it so gently with our cooling jade roller. But still, we can’t win. It puffs up, blackens with fatigue and eats up our concealer like a lion after its prey. We’d prefer to just get along, but if we can’t, we’re going to make sure we come out on top, with eyes bright and sparkling in the spotlight, no matter what it takes. In other words, we’re going to need a little help.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder</a> might as well be the next superhero to get its own movie series. We’d show up on opening night made up for the occasion, a.k.a. wearing this magical powder under our eyes! Someone else who wears this powder to special occasions is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Mandy Moore</strong></a>. Her makeup artist, <strong>Kindra Mann</strong>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">used it to set Moore’s eyes</a> and perfect her look for the unveiling of her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Powder-White.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$28</a> from Violet Grey! Also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nordstrom</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Macy’s</a> in two shades!</strong></p><p>So many shoppers are calling this powder their “holy grail.” With thousands of reviewers across the internet, this “holy grail” status comes as no surprise. One shopper called this powder a “game changer” for their dark circles, while another was relieved to have “finally found a powder that keeps eyeliner from smudging.” Others commented on how it soaks up any of the excess oil on their face all the while brightening them up. Many are big fans of using this “silky and soft” powder for baking, too, helping them to achieve a flawless finish.</p><p>This “light-as-air” powder claims to have an invisible brightening effect, hence why it’s a “secret.” It’s a mostly transparent powder with just the lightest touch of sheer coverage for smoothing out skin, giving us that blurred, air-brushed effect.</p><p>This Laura Mercier powder is also designed to set our concealer and foundation, prolonging the wear of our makeup for all-day, all-night glam. Hopefully it can help keep our concealer steady when we’re sobbing while watching Moore act her heart out on the emotional This Is Us!</p><p>This powder claims not to settle into any fine lines or accentuate our eye bags and any shadows they cast. It’s made of micronized pigments, which may help to eliminate the cakiness that creeps up on us while we’re layering products.</p><p>To use this powder, we just need to pat it under our eyes and over our lids. Don’t drag it over the skin! It helps to use a brush, and it’s recommended we check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Camouflage Powder Brush</a> to get the job done. For the rest of the face, we shouldn’t go crazy. Think of this powder more as a highlighter (but without the distracting glitter). Apply it to areas where the light hits around the eye, like the bridge of the nose or upper cheekbones.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Powder-Shade-2.jpg><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$28</a> from Violet Grey! Also available at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nordstrom</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Macy’s</a> in two shades!</strong></p><p>So why did Laura Mercier choose to create a setting powder specifically for the eye area, as opposed to one for the entire face? The eye skin is different from that of the rest of our face. We use an eye cream before we slather on our moisturizer, so why shouldn’t we use an eye powder before we finish up with our face powder? This powder was created to concentrate further on targeting discoloration, whether sallow or purple-hued, fine lines and wrinkles. One product isn’t always enough, and that’s okay! We’re in this together.</p><p>This product is not only dermatologist tested, but ophthalmologist tested as well. If we’re putting a product so close to our eyes, whether it be skincare or makeup, we need to be sure we’re not going to end up swollen or red and irritated, so we’re always grateful for a medical professional’s approval!</p><p>With this powder, we’re going to make our under-eye area regret not accepting our friendship sooner. Maybe someday we can get there, but for now, we’re not going to be afraid to show it who’s boss. Hollywood, let Us know when we should show up for our own Walk of Fame ceremony!</p><p><strong>See it: Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Mercier Secret Brightening Powder</a> for just <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$28</a> from Violet Grey!
