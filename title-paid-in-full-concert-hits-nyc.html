The line-up included The LOX, the Clipse, M.O.P Noreaga and Cam’ron. By the end of the evening the crowd’s choice was clear: Roc-A-Fellas newest acquisition M.O.P. were the MVPs. They not only rocked the mic with their own hit list but were joined by Gang Starr, Busta Rhymes and Nice and Smooth.</p><p>The event’s hosts were NYC Hot 97’s own Sonny and Mr. Cee. First up was Naam Brigade followed by Benzino. Then The LOX, headed by the “I Get High” guy Styles P stormed out with their D-Block crew. After a rawkus rendition of “Wild Out,” they went into Styles P’s Soundbombing, Vol. 3 hit “My Life” and lit blunts for “Good Times.” The Clipse repped VA with their radio hits “Grindin’,” “When The Last Time” and “Cot Damn” with Ab Liva from Philly’s Major Figgas and Roscoe P. Coldchain. As they exited, Pusha T announced their debut, Lord Willin’ is certified gold after six weeks. Noreaga flanked by C-N-N partner Capone ran down their hot joints, but it wasn’t until N.O.R.E.’s “Superthug,” “Oh No” and his new smash “Nothin'” that the crowd made noize.</p><p>M.O.P., the night’s highlight brought hip-hop’s heaviest weights with ’em. Gang Starr stepped in the arena and Greg Nice and Smooth B took it back to the old school with “Sometimes I Rhyme Slow.” Busta Rhymes dropped his version of “Pass The Courvoisier” and the group ended their set on the loudest note of the night. The crowd screamed as they rapped the remix of “Ante Up.” The evening’s headliner Cam’ron filled the stage with his Diplomat crew, delivering hits “Oh Boy” and “Hey Ma.” Dame Dash even performed his now famous–from–videos dance moves. But it was Juelz Santana that received the biggest applause. A definite crowd-pleaser, the Paid In Full concert sounded a lot like Hot 97’s playlist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZhaH53e9Oiq6WdXqWuqrCMoqVmnqWhuW6vzqeanqqkYrWqwNJmpbKb</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
