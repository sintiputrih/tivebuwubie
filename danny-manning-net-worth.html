He won the Wooden, Eastman, and Naismith Awards during his college basketball career, and in 1988 he competed in the Summer Olympics with the all-amateur USA national basketball team, winning the bronze medal.</p><p>Manning then joined the 1988 NBA Draft, and was selected as the first overall pick by the Los Angeles Clippers, the contract that started to increase his net worth. However, he played very few games during his rookie year due to an injury, but would then start to perform well in the 1992 to 1993 season, such that he was selected to become an All Star. In 1994, he was traded to the Atlanta Hawks, but his persistent knee injuries saw him play very few games in the next few years.
