He then uses Scoop Up to remove the heavily damaged Pokémon to his hand and return them to the Bench, removing all damage from them. He also uses Gust of Wind and Energy Removal to annoy the player, and Gambler and Professor Oak to find cards vital to his strategy. He also has 2 Pokémon Center Cards as a last resort. His strategy constantly draws cards, which if the player can stall him, he can run out of cards in his deck and lose. A deck consisting of Colorless Pokémon with Psychic resistances and/or Gastly and its evolutions, combined with Fighting types without Psychic weaknesses can defeat his Psychic and Colorless Pokémon, respectively.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Quotes>Quotes</span></h3><i>"Hi, I'm Murray, master of the Psychic Club.
