There are so many cute hairstyle trends like these coming your way this winter that’ll add some interest to your ‘do encyclopedia, perhaps taking the place of your go-to ponytail. On the quick and easy end of the spectrum, there are balletcore-inspired dainty hair ribbons, like the kind that has been spotted on Zoë Kravitz and Hailey Bieber, as well as rainbow-hued clip-in extensions that’ll add a pop of color in a snap (literally)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Keep scrolling for the 11 biggest hairstyle trends you’ll see everywhere this winter, according to hair experts.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Priscilla-Inspired Bouffants</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Getty Images/Gareth Cattermole / Staff</p></figure><p>According to celebrity hairstylist and Conair ambassador <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Laura Polko</a>, the bouffant is about to have a major moment for the first time in ages, and it’s all thanks to the newly-released movie Priscilla that showcases Presley’s life.</p><p>A bouffant is a puffy, rounded hairstyle that was big — quite literally — in the ’50s and ’60s. The goal is to add a little — or a lot — of volume at the top of your head by teasing your strands and applying copious amounts of hairspray.</p><p>“Even if you don’t want to do this full style, you can use this technique in so many ways to amp up any look, especially for special events or holiday parties,” Polko tells Bustle.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Colorful Clip-Ins</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>If you’ve been craving a little color this season, you’re in luck. Hairstylist <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Dhairius Thomas</a> predicts you’ll see a lot of contrasting highlights, and all you need to achieve them are a couple of <a href=#>clip-in extensions</a>.</p><p>“The benefit of this hairstyle is that there’s no chemical risk or damage done to the hair, and no commitment to maintain color,” he tells Bustle. It’s all about having fun, whether you rock the extensions for a week or just a night out.</p><p>Thomas suggests using clip-ins that pop against your hair color. “Great color combos are usually black and blonde, black and red, and reds and blondes,” he says.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Messy Buns</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Ashley Jahncke / Getty Images</p></figure><p>Sofia Richie Grainge made everyone fall in love with her extra sleek slicked-back bun, but it may be time to loosen it up a little.</p><p>From the runways of 3.1 Phillip Lim to Khaite, a <a href=#>messier version of the bun was spotted all over New York Fashion Week</a> — and the style will be everywhere in the new year.</p><p>While the slicked-back portion of this hairstyle remains the same, the bun gets a messy makeover with pulled-out pieces and loose tendrils to create a laidback, slightly undone vibe.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Hair Clips</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>This winter, it may be time to take your hair accessory collection beyond your go-to claw clip. According to Polko, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>chic French clips</a> are a fun new way to sweep your hair up and back. She also points to metallic snap clips, which can be lined up in a row to keep your bangs back.</p><p>“These stylish clips combine style and function,” she tells Bustle. “Whether you're heading to a holiday party or a cozy winter gathering, they make for a great winter hair accessory.”</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">5</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Ribbons & Bows</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"><p>WWD/WWD/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Balletcore ribbons and bows have been having a moment, and that’ll continue into winter — and beyond.</p><p>As Polko says, a <a href=#>balletcore ribbon</a> is the perfect way to add a little flirty touch to your hair, whether you tie it at the end of your braids or the top of your ponytail.</p><p>Ribbons also look pretty when they’re worn loose or <a href=#>woven into a bun for a corset effect</a>, à la the runway at Christian Sirano’s Spring/Summer 2024 show.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">’90s Bombshell Waves</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>As if ribbons weren’t pretty enough, brace yourself for the resurgence of glamour with some sexy, swoopy waves, like the kind supermodel Cindy Crawford wore in the ’90s, says <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Ashlee Norman</a>, a colorist and Schwarzkopf Professional ambassador. “The supers are super hot again, so it's time to get out that round brush and hot rollers.”</p><p>This bombshell hair has been spotted on <a href=#>Sabrina Carpenter</a>, and it’s also big on TikTok where Victoria’s Secret models have been showing off their <a href=# rel=noreferrer>runway-worthy waves</a>.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">7</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Rearranging Parts</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Daniele Venturelli/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>According to Brittany Johnson, a licensed multicultural hairstylist and senior brand marketing manager at beauty brand <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Mayvenn</a>, the classic <a href=#>middle part</a> will remain a staple into the new year. That said, it’s high time the <a href=#>side part</a> gets a little love, too.</p><p>Middle parts look chic with slicked-back buns, Johnson says, but consider switching things up by wearing your hair down with curls or waves with a deep side part, like Zendaya — it serves old Hollywood glamour.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">8</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Day Three Hair</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Victor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</p></figure><p>The Miu Miu Ready to Wear Spring/Summer 2024 showed models <a href=#>rocking day three hair</a> for a brand new take on the wet hair trend.</p><p>Instead of a slicked-back look, it was all about greasy bangs, shiny roots, and half-wet-looking hair that embraced imperfect, slightly dirty-looking strands.</p><p>The style was also a hit at the Jason Wu show, where lead hairstylist <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Jimmy Paul</a> went for wet-looking finger waves meant to make it look like the models just emerged from a shipwreck.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">9</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Glossy Braids</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>This winter is the ideal time to rock a low, long braid down your back.</p><p>According to Polko, this type of braid is one of the best <a href=#>ways to camouflage greasy hair</a> — and it always looks chic.</p><p>For something even more youthful, rock <a href=#>braided pigtails</a> like Selena Gomez for a little nostalgia and whimsy.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">10</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Tucked Back</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5" readability=2><p>Getty Images/Daniele Venturelli / Contributor</p></figure><p>When was the time you wore your hair tucked behind your ears? Whether you have long strands or a bouncy bob, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Amy Abramite</a>, a stylist and creative director at <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Maxine Salon</a> in Chicago says a quick tuck can change everything.</p><p>Hair pulled back behind the ears looks neat and effortlessly elegant, she tells Bustle. Take, for example, Laura Harrier’s bob, which gives off an entirely different vibe when styled this way.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">11</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">“I Don’t Care” Hair</h2></p><figure class="Qf5 p-5"></figure><p>The vibe with “I don’t care” hair is unstyled, lived in, and relaxed, says <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Wes Sharpton</a>, a stylist and lead brand educator with <a href=# rel=noreferrer>Hairstory</a>.</p><p>“It’s a low-maintenance statement look that perfectly captures an effortlessly chic style,” he tells Bustle, adding that it’s a good option when you’re growing out a shorter cut.</p><p>Lady Gaga recently wore effortless waves with a blazer. Another take is to pull on a sweater and leave your ends tucked in à la Mary Kate and Ashley. Either way, it’s extra casual and will feel just right during a busy winter season.</p></figure><p>Sources:</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Laura Polko</a>, celebrity hairstylist, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Conair</a> ambassador</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ashlee Norman</a>, colorist, Schwarzkopf Professional ambassador</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Dhairius Thomas</a>, hairstylist</p><p>Brittany Johnson, licensed multicultural hairstylist, senior brand marketing manager at <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Mayvenn</a></p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Amy Abramite</a>, stylist, creative director at <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Maxine Salon</a> in Chicago</p><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Wes Sharpton</a>, stylist, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Hairstory</a> lead brand educator</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on November 7, 2023</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCuxJqsrbFfrLavwMSrZGtoYml6qa3Iq6qtsZyaerW%2BxKebrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
