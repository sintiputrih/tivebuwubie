The long-time <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">game show host recently opened up about his decision to retire</a>.</p><p>In anticipation of his final episode on Friday, Good Morning America aired a montage showcasing Pat’s 40-year career. The throwback clips featured a younger version of Sajak alongside Vanna, during key moments from the hit show, which catapulted both of them into fame.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/pat-sajak-on-the-set-of-wheel-of-fortune.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="These Are The Moments Pat Sajak Seems To Hate The Most On Wheel Of Fortune">These Are The Moments Pat Sajak Seems To Hate The Most On Wheel Of Fortune</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Pat Sajak seems thoroughly unimpressed with some of his contestants; here's what he seems to hate the most on Wheel of Fortune.</p><h2 id=why-sajak-feels-the-time-is-right-to-retire>Why Sajak Feels The Time Is Right To Retire</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/pat-sajak.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the nearly four-minute segment, Maggie Sajak, 29, who serves as Wheel of Fortune's social media correspondent, interviewed her father about his retirement, including what prompted the decision.</p><p>Pat explained his perspective on retiring at the right time, saying, "I believed I should leave a couple of years too early than a couple of years too late." He pondered aloud, "Could I still do it? Yeah, I think I could for a while."</p><p>However, he acknowledged the desire to pursue other interests, adding, "There's also other things in life we'd like to do." He mentioned his retirement plans, humorously stating he would be content spending his time doing "crossword puzzles and playing with his grandchildren."</p><p>Reflecting on his career, Pat shared, "I'm enjoying this last year. It's been a great 40 years. I'm looking forward to whatever is ahead."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to Maggie, Pat and his wife, Lesly Brown, have a son named Patrick. Like his sister, Patrick does not yet have children for their grandfather to play with, a fact that Pat lightheartedly alluded to during the interview. Sajak joked, "Hint. Hint. Hint. No pressure," prompting Maggie to laugh and smile at the camera.</p><h2 id=why-ryan-seacrest-is-a-controversial-lsquo-wheel-of-fortune-rsquo-host>Why Ryan Seacrest Is A Controversial ‘Wheel of Fortune’ Host</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/copy-of-untitled-10-1.jpg><p>Ryan Seacrest will be stepping into Pat’s shoes as his replacement, which may not be a surprise given Ryan’s long history as a T.V. host, including for shows like American Idol.
