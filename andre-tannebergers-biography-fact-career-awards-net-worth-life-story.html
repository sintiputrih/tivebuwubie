Also known in the stage name of ATB, he was born on February 26, 1973 in Freiberg, Saxony, Germany.</p><p>ATB used to frequent club Tarm Center in Bochum every weekend during the late 1980’s. This served as his inspiration to try to create dance music. In 1992, he began experimenting and later released his first singles as part of the electronic music group, Sequential One, throughout the early 1990’s. The group’s popularity has grown over the years yet they ultimately disbanded in 1999.</p><p>Andre Tanneberger then started working on his solo project called ATB. His first single “9pm (Till I Come)” from his debut album <i>Movin’ Melodies</i> was a massive hit. It is widely recognized as the first Trance #1. From then on, he has released seven more albums such as <i>Two Worlds, Dedicated, Addicted to Music, No Silence, Trilogy, Future Memories</i> and <i>Distant Earth</i>. He also tours regularly.</p><p>ATB was ranked #11 in 2009 according to the official world rankings by <i>DJ Magazine</i>. He was in the same position in 2010 but went down to #15 in 2011. He was ranked as world number 1 in 2011 according to <i>The DJ Lost</i>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmemb%2BmedOapaedkpq%2FqLHRrGSboZ%2Bcv6K8x7Jkn5mTqXqkrdGenKtlkayus7DSZqWerF2svLPAx2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
