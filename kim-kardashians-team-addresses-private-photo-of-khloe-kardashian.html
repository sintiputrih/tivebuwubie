While the Revenge Body host has yet to publicly comment on the picture, she has admitted to using Photoshop in the past.</p><p>“Facetune is the best thing to bring to the table. It’s life-changing,” Khloé said during an appearance on <a href=#><strong>Chelsea Handler</strong></a>’s former Netflix docuseries, Chelsea Does, in February 2016. “It’s the only way to live. … It’s not real, you are presenting to the world what you want them to believe you are. It’s amazing. I think our society nowadays is so caught up on getting validation from the social world that no one really knows, so they post these things.”</p><p>More recently, <a href=#>Khloé commented on a TikTok about her body transformation.</a></p><p>“I don’t want anyone to kiss my ass. I’m not asking for that,” she wrote last month. “But what I am asking for is for people to realize just what articles like this does to someone’s soul and confidence. I am so very grateful and appreciative of anyone who stands up to bullying or people writing story’s simply for clickbait. Defending someone, especially when we don’t know one another makes me heart happy. That’s the person I am. I like to defend what is right.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>An insider previously told Us Weekly that Khloé <a href=#>tries to ignore any hate about her ever-changing appearance.</a></p><p>“Khloé doesn’t care about the backlash she’s been getting from fans saying she doesn’t look like herself in her recent photos,” the source told Us exclusively in June 2020. “She thinks she looks great. And actually [she] does not care what people think as long as she’s happy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ1iuKK%2Bw5qqoaGRo8BuwMSapGaZlJm%2Fpr%2FSnqpmqKKew6LAxGanoaekpHqwsoykn6WnlWK4or7DmqqhoZGjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
