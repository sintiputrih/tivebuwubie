They’re an extension of the joy one feels when their favorite team has scored a goal, whether to open a game or to cap off an overtime thriller. Some songs have been staples in their arena for quite some time, while others are newer, as teams try to modernize their fan experience.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>But not all goal songs are created equally.</p><p>We (Mark Lazerus, Scott Powers and Julian McKenzie) asked The Athletic’s subscribers to rate every NHL goal song from 1-10 (10 being the best), so we could determine once and for all which team has the best one. More than 2,500 of you took the challenge. Here are the results, with your comments (and some of our own).</p><p>(Note: The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Buffalo Sabres</a>, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Florida Panthers</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Washington Capitals</a> use only individual songs for each player, so they’re not included in this ranking.)</p><h2>1. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Seattle Kraken</a>: ‘Lithium’ by Nirvana (6.63 average)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> This is almost cheating, picking an all-time song from an all-time band. But it’s Seattle, man. It works.</p><p><strong>Powers:</strong> Laz, I’m shocked you didn’t make a push for Pearl Jam instead. I do think “Leash” would make for a great goal song somewhere.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Lithium instantly became one of the best goal songs in the league. Using a legendary local band just makes it even better.”</li><li class=p1>“Nirvana’s Lithium. Hands down. The best.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>2. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Ottawa Senators</a>: ‘Song 2’ by Blur (6.54)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> This was the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Penguins’</a> goal song back when I covered them right out of school TWENTY-TWO years ago. The classics never die.</p><p><strong>McKenzie:</strong> Can’t beat the classics. Even with “Song 2,” a song that has seemingly been associated with some kind of sport since its release.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Song 2 has been used in Ottawa for YEARS. Please select a new goal song. Love, Sens fan”</li><li class=p1>“Not a Sens fan, but Song 2 is absolutely the greatest goal song of the last 20 years.”</li><li class=p1>“I am sure music freaks are going to drool over Ottawa using a Blur song. NO. It is a BAD CHOICE for a goal song. a goal song is supposed to make people CHANT and GO CRAZY and think YEAH WE ARE GOING TO F—— KILL THIS GUY.”</li><li class=p1>“Song 2 is so simple and to the point. Woo-hoo. Don’t need to say anymore. It’s perfect.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>3. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Chicago Blackhawks</a>: ‘Chelsea Dagger’ by The Fratellis (6.48)</h2><p><strong>Powers:</strong> Put me in the category of the Blackhawks needing a change. The song defines the period of the three Stanley Cups. It’s time for something different. There are so many great Chicago musicians to choose from, too.</p><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> The song that haunts my dreams. Well, less so this season because they so rarely score goals.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Can’t stand the Blackhawks but Chelsea Dagger is objectively the best song in the league.”</li><li class=p1>“I truly can’t stand Chelsea Dagger and hope they don’t get Bedard so I don’t have to hear it as often.”</li><li class=p1>“Chelsea Dagger is the definition of either you love it or hate it. Personally I love it.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>4. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>New York Rangers</a>: ‘Slapshot’ by Ray Castoldi (6.39)</h2><p><strong>McKenzie:</strong> It’s an easy, catchy song to sing when the Rangers score at the Garden. Sometimes, simplicity works best.</p><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> Meh.</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“The Rangers might be the most generic hockey team in the league, and kudos to them for finding their generic equivalent of a song.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>5. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Minnesota Wild</a>: ‘Shout’ by The Isley Brothers (6.03)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> What, was Prince’s “Let’s Go Crazy” too cool or something?</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>McKenzie:</strong> Love the Isley Brothers. Love this pick. If you’re not going to pick Prince, this is a cool, unique pick.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Shout — great goal song, great party song, great singalong… it’s just perfect.”.</li><li class=p1>“Shout is by far the worst, as a Wild fan. How is that supposed to excite you and get you amped up?”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>6. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Boston Bruins</a>: ‘KernKraft 400’ by Zombie Nation (5.79)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> I’ve lost all faith in our readership. How is this in the top 31, let alone the top 10?</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Zombie Nation and Chelsea Dagger need to die.”</li><li class=p1>“Am I allowed to hate the Bruins’ song simply because of all the traumatic memories of my childhood — being a <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Canucks</a> fan?”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>7. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Columbus Blue Jackets</a>: ‘For Those About to Rock’ by AC/DC (5.71)</h2><p><strong>Powers:</strong> As a visitor, you can never prepare yourself for the cannon well enough.</p><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> Nah, you’ve just got to learn the choreography. “FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, FIRE (cover ears) WE SALUUUUUTE YOU!”</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Intro to Columbus may be unmatched. Horn, vocals, instruments. Fire. (This from a) Minnesota fan”</li><li class=p1>“AC/DC wails, so props to the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Flames</a> and Blue Jackets for utilizing them. Blue Jackets lose a few points for transitioning to some pop song that features some sort of stupid chanting, which is a massive turn-off for me when it comes to sports anthems; the chanting comes off as too contrived and calculated.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>8. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Arizona Coyotes</a>: ‘Howlin’ For You’ by The Black Keys (5.59)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> Good tune, good band, good wordplay.</p><p><strong>Powers:</strong> Who would have thought Mullet Arena would hear this song as much as it has this season?</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Boston and NYR have the most iconic goal songs in hockey, but I think people sleep on Arizona. That s— slaps!”</li><li class=p1>“The Coyotes have to have the worst song behind the Blackhawks, which I naturally hate because I am a <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Blues</a> fan.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>9. New York Islanders: ‘Crowd Chant’ by Joe Satriani (5.52)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> The “Yes! Yes! Yes!” chant after goals was the best thing in the NHL. That it immediately followed one of the very worst goal songs in the NHL made it all the better.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Islanders</a> use of Joe Satriani feels so dated and uninspired, like they went to a bunch of Wild or Rangers games in 2006 and said ‘If it’s good enough for them, it’s good enough for us.’ So much good music has come from Long Island. Why choose to sound so generic?”</li><li class=p1>“The entire Islander fanbase is begging for a new goal song but can’t figure out what it would be.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>10. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dallas Stars</a>: ‘Puck Off’ by Pantera (5.51)</h2><p><strong>Powers:</strong> This would have been in my top five.</p><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> This one is great live in the arena and belongs higher. It’s one thing to have a band write a goal song just for you. It’s another thing to have freaking PANTERA do it.</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“The Dallas Stars’ song by Pantera is perfect. It has strong ties to the local music scene and bespoke songs get extra credit in my book.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>11. Pittsburgh Penguins: ‘Party Hard’ by Andrew W.K. (5.50)</h2><p><strong>McKenzie:</strong> One of the best in the league. Also great as a standalone song.</p><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> This one doesn’t really work all that great as a goal song, but I love it all the same because of the way Andrew W.K. embraced it back in 2015. That was fun stuff. So glad the Penguins brought it back after abandoning it.</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Pittsburgh is a 20/10. Absolutely perfect.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>12. Nashville Predators: ‘I Like It, I Love It’ by Tim McGraw and ‘Gold on the Ceiling’ by The Black Keys (5.42)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> Love the Black Keys, want to vomit every time I hear the Tim McGraw part.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Powers:</strong> I know <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nashville</a> fans think I hate them for my Norris Trophy voting, but this song is just so fitting for this place. The atmosphere is among the best in the league.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Nashville should never change their goal song. It’s perfect for Nashville and the atmosphere in Bridgestone Arena.”</li><li class=p1>“The Preds is the only goal song I consider absolutely atrocious.”</li><li class=p1>“Tim McGraw and the Nashville Predators has haunted my dreams for years now. It’s hard to explain how irrationally angry that song makes me.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>13. Calgary Flames: ‘TNT’ by AC/DC (5.41)</h2><p><strong>McKenzie:</strong> The Flames will start with “TNT” before adding an individual goal song. I get a kick out of hearing this classic rock song before it jumps to random songs such as “Nas Is Like” by Nas. (Guess which Flames player has that song as their goal song. One guess.)</p><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> I love the flames shooting out of the corners of the rink while “TNT” blares. You can feel the heat in that dangling death box of doom they call a press box.</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li>“It’s Leafs and Bruins. then Flames. then everyone else.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>14. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>San Jose Sharks</a>: ‘Get Ready for This’ by 2 Unlimited (5.40)</h2><p><strong>Powers:</strong> We need to convince The Athletic’s Corey Masisak to track down the Belgium dance music duo of 2 Unlimited to get their thoughts on the Sharks still playing this song.</p><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> Did Sharks fans pick this as a gag back in 2016? Like a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Boaty McBoatface</a> situation? I can’t believe we’re doing Jock Jams in the year 2023.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“I sincerely hate the anthems that are basketball arena music. Like, c’mon Sharks.”</li><li class=p1>“I didn’t think any of them could be worse than the Wild, and then I heard the Sharks.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>15. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Toronto Maple Leafs</a>: ‘You Make My Dreams’ by Hall and Oates (5.30)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> First time I heard this, I thought it was a gag. Second time I heard this, I hated it. But after 10,000 times, I can’t lie, I friggin’ love it. And I cover the Blackhawks, so I hear it a *lot* when I’m in Toronto. Top five in the league for me.</p><p><strong>Powers:</strong> We could have devoted another story to people’s opinions on this song.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“As a Bruins fan, I can’t stand the Leafs goal song. It is f—king annoying. But I guess that just means it is good. 9/10.”</li><li class=p1>“I know I’m in the minority as a Leafs fan, but I don’t understand the hate for Hall and Oates. It’s such a different vibe than all the generic meh rock-sounding goal songs out there that all blend together. It’s a ton of fun, and it’s the vibe of a team I want to cheer for when they score a goal.</li></ul><h2 class=p1>16. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Winnipeg Jets</a>: ‘Gonna Celebrate’ by The Phantoms (5.17)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> The Jets get the best of both worlds, with a team song followed by an individual song. I’m torn on the concept, though. There’s something so communal about a goal song. Not to mention how many times a goal is credited to the wrong guy at first.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“I like individual goal songs. Credit to Winnipeg Jets.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>17. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>New Jersey Devils</a>: ‘Howl’ by Gaslight Anthem (5.13)</h2><p><strong>Powers:</strong> This is one of the few bands I actually listen to. I approve.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“I love New Jersey’s ‘Howl’ from Gaslight Anthem. Even if my team gets scored upon, I’m not getting a headache or annoyed like some other teams.”</li><li class=p1>“The ‘You Suck’ thing that we as Devils fans continue to do is brutal. What, are we a bunch of 10-year-olds? I’m sick of the goal song being more about the other team. Time to move on. I always thought the intro to ‘Shout at The Devil’ or the outro to ‘Born to Run’ would be awesome goal songs. If fans chant ‘You Suck’ they should be kicked out of the arena. Time to grow up. Our team is 40 years old.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>18. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Anaheim Ducks</a>: ‘Bro Hymn’ by Pennywise (5.10)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> This ranking is outrageous. HOW DO WE HAVE JOCK JAMS AHEAD OF (the admittedly horribly named) BRO HYMN?</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Bro Hymn is the perfect goal song. It’s easy to pick up even if you’ve never heard it before”.</li><li class=p1>“No particular love for the Ducks, but the choice of Bro Hymn as their goal song is a 10 hands down. All-Time classic song. No notes.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>19. Vegas Golden Knights: ‘Vegas Lights’ by Panic! At The Disco (5.05)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> This just does not work. Not live, not on TV. “Viva Las Vegas,” corny as it is, would work better than this.</p><p><strong>Powers:</strong> I agree. For everything the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Golden Knights</a> do right, this could be done better.</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Can’t believe how seamlessly Vegas Lights fits as a goal song. May Vegas never change it.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>20. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Los Angeles Kings</a>: ‘LA Kings Goal Song (Hey, Hey)’ by Twilight Trio (4.81)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> Super generic. Like the goal song from an unlicensed video game. Just let <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dieter Ruhle</a> go nuts on the organ after each goal.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“As a Kings fan, I just wish ours was a little more creative. It sounds similar to the Rangers’ goal song. Bring back ‘I Love LA’ by Randy Newman!”</li><li class=p1>“Kings ripping off NYR. Bad look.”</li><li class=p1>“I love teams that created their own original songs. It stands out from everyone else and screams for an advantage.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>21. Vancouver Canucks: ‘Don’t You (Forget About Me)’ by Simple Minds (4.79)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> I nearly fell out of the press box upon hearing this at Rogers Arena this season. How is this a goal song? It’s got all the camp of Hall and Oates with none of the fun. It’d be better if every player celebrated every goal by raising a fist and freeze-framing, Judd Nelson-style.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Vancouver’s song is a prime example of their disarray.”</li><li class=p1>“As much as I like the Canucks’ goal song, I give it a bad grade because it sounds less like a celebration of a goal and more like a desperate plea for relevancy. Honestly baffled that anyone in the organization green-lit that one.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>22. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Carolina Hurricanes</a>: ‘Raise Up’ by Petey Pablo (4.70)</h2><p><strong>McKenzie:</strong> I am so mad this song is ranked as low as it is. This ranking is an affront to North Carolina and everyone who raises up, takes their shirt off, twists it ’round their heads and spins it like a helicopter. This is one of my favorite goal songs in the league.</p><p><strong>Powers:</strong> Yeah, I thought this song would have finished much higher, too.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“I’m an Avs fan, and couldn’t care less about the Canes. But Carolina has the best goal song and it’s not even close.”</li><li class=p1>“The general lack of hip-hop is just sad.”</li><li class=p1>“People are going to hate the Hurricanes one, but it works so well in the arena. Perfect goal song for that team.”</li><li class=p1>“Also a huge fan of the Canes’ ‘Raise Up’. I wish more teams would branch out like that instead of commissioning the 100th straight iteration of “Woah Woah HEY HEY!”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>23. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Montreal Canadiens</a>: ‘Canadiens Goal Song’ by Antoine Beck (4.56)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Heyzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz…</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>Hot take: I never really liked this goal song. I much preferred when they had “Vertigo” by U2.</li><li class=p1>“Habs should bring back <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Le But from Loco Locass</a> ….!!!”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>24. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Detroit Red Wings</a>: ‘Let’s Go Red Wings’ by Fred Coury (4.54)</h2><p><strong>Powers:</strong> Of note, the person who wrote this song was the drummer for the glam metal band Cinderella. He’s apparently a big hockey fan.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li>“The Blues and Wings are both terrible generic songs.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>25. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Edmonton Oilers</a>: ‘Fluxland’ by XL (4.52)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again: Bring back Metric’s “Stadium Love”!</p><p><strong>McKenzie:</strong> Seconded.</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li class=p1>“Fluxland is probably the best Oilers goal song they’ve ever had. Massive improvement over ‘Hell Ya!’ by Rev Theory.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>26. St. Louis Blues: ‘Let’s Go Blues’ by The Urge (4.50)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> The organist playing “When the Saints Go Marching In” is the best part of a Blues goal.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li>“The Blues song is just so bad.”</li><li>“I love that the Blues have their own unique song that has a big band feel. The song reflects the team name, awesome.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>27. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Philadelphia Flyers</a>: ‘Celtic Invasion (Becky Lynch’s entrance music)’ by CFO$ (4.44)</h2><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> I know the hockey/wrestling Venn diagram is basically a circle, but I’m not feeling this one.</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li>“Philly should have to pick a new one, Becky Lynch is associated with being the best and winning championships, clearly Philly didn’t get the memo.”</li><li>“The Flyers goal song is absolutely horrific”</li></ul><p><strong>Lazerus:</strong> At least the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Tesla coils</a> are cool as hell.</p><p><strong>Reader comment:</strong></p><ul><li>“Lightning fan here and I hate ours. It’s just bland. When Stamkos scores, they play ‘Hammer time’ which is kinda neat.”</li></ul><h2 class=p1>29. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Colorado Avalanche</a>: Chase The Sun by Planet Funk (3.34)</h2><p><strong>McKenzie:</strong> Probably because they already use “All The Small Things” in the third period. I know other teams also do this, but it’s Colorado’s thing now. They might be better off asking for <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Nathan MacKinnon</a>’s opinion for a new goal song, even if it means he’ll probably choose something from Gunna (If he does, just use the hook from Gunna and Lil Baby’s “Drip Too Hard”).</p><p><strong>Reader comments:</strong></p><ul><li>“There’s so many good ones and that’s the song the Colorado Avalanche pick?”</li><li>“WTV is the Avs song?”</li></ul><p>(Photo: Steph Chambers / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2xqb3Fga3xzfJFsZmlrX2eBcLrHpWSgp5GherS7zaCqZqqRo7iqusasZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
