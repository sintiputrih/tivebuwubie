From underground wine cellars to Batcave-like garages, homeowners are designing living spaces with plenty of concealed nooks and crannies to ensure a quick getaway — or perhaps to simply take their home to the next level."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If you look behind a bookcase, under a trap door, or down an obscure staircase, there may be more property lurking. Secret rooms and passages that may have been <a href=#>a part of the house</a> from the very beginning or <a href=#>savvy additions</a> added later on by inspired homeowners.</p><p>From underground wine cellars to Batcave-like garages, homeowners are designing living spaces with plenty of concealed nooks and crannies to ensure a quick getaway — or perhaps to simply take their home to the next level. Below are some of the more innovative hidden spaces from around the globe.</p><span class=visually-hidden>Previous</span> <span class=visually-hidden>Next</span><p>Architecture firm&nbsp;DA Studio&nbsp;and artist Richard Woods created the four-story Rainbow House in downtown London. With transforming furniture, rotatable rooms, and a vibrant&nbsp;spiral staircase that spans four floors and showcases the&nbsp;entire color&nbsp;spectrum, this home is a sight to behold. One of the true gems inside of the Rainbow House, however, is the secret passage&nbsp;built directly into the floor of the master suite. Using this hidden doorway and a connected slide, individuals can quickly transition from the bedroom to the recreational room below.</p><span class=visually-hidden>Previous</span> <span class=visually-hidden>Next</span><p>Plain walls and doors are boring. Why not jazz up your living room and add a rotating wall? This wall, made of a black metal framework and plywood, transforms the living room into a kitchen and reveals the home’s TV set. The faceted panels can also be set apart and used to separate two individual rooms.</p><span class=visually-hidden>Previous</span> <span class=visually-hidden>Next</span><p>Love wine but can’t find a fresh spot in your home to store your collection? United Kingdom-based company Spiral Cellars can solve this problem for you. The company is well known for its dynamic wine cellars, like this underground beauty that is installed on your ground floor.</p><span class=visually-hidden>Previous</span> <span class=visually-hidden>Next</span><p>Need to escape after dinner for some quiet time to think and reflect (and digest)? This stunning Jefferson, New York home has a secret doorway installed in the kitchen ground floor that leads to another section of the house.</p><span class=visually-hidden>Previous</span> <span class=visually-hidden>Next</span><p>Sometimes what’s behind a bookcase is even better than&nbsp;what it holds on its shelves. A spacious wine cellar rests behind a bookshelf in this beautiful home in&nbsp;Tacoma, Washington, for example. It definitely comes in handy while you’re submerged in a Danielle Steele novel.</p><span class=visually-hidden>Previous</span> <span class=visually-hidden>Next</span><p>This country-style house is straight out of a fairy tale and rests on a hill in rural Maine.&nbsp;A&nbsp;hidden passageway&nbsp;lies behind a bookcase that’s located in&nbsp;the turquoise-painted common room,&nbsp;allowing quick entry into&nbsp;a secret bathroom. Talk about a great escape.</p><span class=visually-hidden>Previous</span> <span class=visually-hidden>Next</span><p>We thought a house like this only existed in The Dark Knight films. Made to replicate the iconic superhero’s pad, this house was&nbsp;built with an underground parking garage that’s accessible from the house’s tennis court. With illuminated lights on the ceiling and grey tiles on the floor, this will make any average Joe instantly feel like Batman.</p><p>The architecture firm Creative Home Engineering specializes in an array of custom hidden doorways for your home. The company features one of its electronic models at the nine-second mark in the video above. With the click of a button, a staircase lifts, allowing individuals to access a hidden recreational room.</p><h4 class="b-editors-recs-title h-editors-recs-title">Editors' Recommendations</h4><span id=publisher-md itemprop=publisher itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Organization><span itemprop=url itemtype=https://schema.org/Url content="https://www.digitaltrends.com"><span itemprop=logo itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXGoquapKSnsq%2Bw0meaqKVfnbyusY6hpqado2LEqsDHZqqem6KawW68wKyqmp%2BVqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
