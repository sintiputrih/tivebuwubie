A Twitter user screen-recorded part of the live in question, and posted the clip claiming, &#34;"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She&nbsp;maintains her&nbsp;disgusted&nbsp;expression&nbsp;as she continues, "if you ever f*cking play with me like that again, I will f*cking drag you to the f*cking pits of hell." Ari tries to move on by saying, "Anyway," but&nbsp;appears to give it&nbsp;some more thought and&nbsp;makes various repulsed faces in the process. Though it is not certain&nbsp;whether Ari&nbsp;was actually reacting&nbsp;to this&nbsp;exact question in the clip, as the supposed comment is&nbsp;no longer visible&nbsp;on the screen by the time the clip starts,&nbsp;it would make sense since Moneybagg Yo did recently confirm his relationship with a different Ari. It&nbsp;had been rumoured that&nbsp;Moneybagg&nbsp;was romantically involved with <a href=# class=text-word rel>G Herbo</a>'s ex, Ari Fletcher, for a hot minute before&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Moneybagg finally confirmed their relationship this past week.</a>&nbsp;The fresh status of&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Moneybagg's relationship with a woman named Ari</a>&nbsp;meant that&nbsp;some were still out of the loop on just who his new boo was, leading this innocent viewer to confuse Ari Lennox with Ari Fletcher.</p><p>Many users replied to the tweet of the clip, some claiming that her reaction was disrespectful&nbsp;or offensive. One person tweeted, "Didnt she just have a melt down cuz someone didnt find her attractive ?" referring to the recent debacle in which Ari responded to <a href=# rel>a tweet&nbsp;that compared her physical appearance to&nbsp;a rottweiler,</a>&nbsp;upset at the&nbsp;<a href=# rel>racist implications of the insult.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Another user also brought up&nbsp;<a href=# rel>the rottweiler comment</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;coming to Ari's defense and saying,&nbsp;"y’all in these comments coming to moneybag yo defense...but where was her defense when she was out here being torn down for having features she was born with. black features at that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdiaoJxf5dmmKuhXaGyr7rOsWSdoaOcwrTAxJ1kmp6kmr9ussCnZKudoKS%2FtbHDpbBmmaOgwG60xKtkop5dqLWmv4ydmK2hnpx6rrvNnrCbmZecerq7jKGcpaRdo7xuusSwqg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
