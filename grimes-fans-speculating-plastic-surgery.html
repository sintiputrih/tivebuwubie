And now, a week later, Grimes has shared another post-op photo without the bandages, but it’s still not apparent.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=521 data-injectable=true>“R selfies obsolete yet?” she tweeted, sharing another photo of herself with oversized lips and her silver-lavender hair braided into pigtails. “I am very seriously considering getting a white ink tattoo on my face next week.

It’s the opinion of this author that she probably got her ears pinned back, a procedure known as otoplasty — which perhaps might be a first step into her quest for elf ears.</p><p data-characters=148 data-current-count=148 data-injectable=false>But of course, that’s all just speculation, as her fans likewise went into serious detective mode trying to figure out what’s different.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=511 data-injectable=true>“What was the surgery that you’ve mentioned here we wanna knowww,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> one Twitter user, while another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a>: “You can see where the injections were to her lips but I def thought there were gonna be elf ears under the head wrap too and you def don’t need to be in a hospital gown for fillers lol so I’m wondering the same.”</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Others expressed concern about Grimes’s rapidly transforming appearance. “Post-billionaire body dysmorphia phase in full swing!” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> another user. “Don’t slice off too much of yourself, you are fine just as you are.” Others <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">floated</a> that she was “serving allergic reaction” and needs an epi-pen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">or that</a> she no longer looks like herself.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=613 data-injectable=false>In either case, try as fans might, it seems unlikely that Grimes will be dissuaded from getting a face tattoo or elf ears, so everyone may as well get used to the idea now — for better or worse. (But almost certainly worse.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S0s7XMnqpmnpGjwG6%2Fz56arqSRqbavs4ypo5qrpJ6wbr%2FUq56eqqlk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
