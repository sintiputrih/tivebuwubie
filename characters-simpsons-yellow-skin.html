In a 2000 documentary dissecting his career, the animator recalled when, how and why the decision was made.</p><p>“If you’re flicking around with your channel changer very fast,” he said, “and you zoom by The Simpsons&nbsp;and there’s nothing else that looks like them on TV, they stand out.”</p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>Standing out was important, not because there were a lot of adult-oriented cartoons, but because there weren’t any at all. Around the time that Groening made his magnum opus, animation was by and large thought to be for children. Sure, there were a handful of shows that had already broken the mold, but they came nowhere near the level of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cultural relevance which&nbsp;The Simpsons&nbsp;achieved</a> in its prime.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The-Simpsons.jpg alt=The-Simpsons width=1780 height=910 sizes="(max-width: 1780px) 100vw, 1780px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=440 data-current-count=440 data-injectable=true>Of course, the yellow skin is not the only design hallmark of the show. Another prominent feature is the characters’ hairlines – or, rather, absence of. While Homer and Marge sport distinct haircuts, their kids lack that line which divides their head from their hair. It shouldn’t work, and yet it does. For what it’s worth, it’s helped make Bart in particular one of America’s most recognizable doodles.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Not all characters in&nbsp;<strong>The Simpsons</strong>&nbsp;have yellow skin, though. Some who are drawn with different tones include Krusty the Clown, who covers his yellow skin with white make-up, as well as Apu, an Indian store clerk whom colorists rendered in a dark brown tone. Apu’s character, in particular, has proven problematic, causing a bit of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">controversy</a> not too long ago.</p><p data-characters=142 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=false>But for those wondering what’s up with the yellow skin, there you have it.
