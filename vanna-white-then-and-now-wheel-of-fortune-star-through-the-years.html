However, her folks divorced when Vanna was just a baby.</p><p>Vanna was destined to be a star from the get-go though, as even before she graced our TV screens she found herself as a contestant in the Miss Georgia 1978 pageant, two years before her almost run-in with Bob. Her life changed forever in October 1982, when Wheel of Fortune hostess Susan Stafford left the show, and Vanna became one of three fill-ins.</p><p>In December 1982, Vanna became the permanent hostess, and she has remained in that spot ever since right beside host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Pat Sajak</strong></a>. Vanna has gone on to write various books, made several cameo appearances on TV shows and has even received her own star on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>. Today, she is also a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mother to two kids</a> — Niko and Gigi — who she shares with her ex-husband George Santo Pietro.
