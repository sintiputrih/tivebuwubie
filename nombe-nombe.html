And although Nombe nombe is a genus of kangaroo all its own, it’s no coincidence that it has similarities with Australia’s kangaroos.</p><p>That’s because Nombe nombe may have evolved from an ancient species of kangaroo that migrated into New Guinea from Australia about five to eight million years ago when the two landmasses were connected by a land bridge. According to Science Alert, rising sea levels eventually separated the two.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-385321 alt="Nombe Jaw 3D Rendering" width=800 height=493 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/nombe-jaw-3d-rendering.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-385321 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Flinders University</span><span class=caption-body>A 3D rendering of Nombe nombe‘s jaw.</span></p><p>But species that seem to mirror each other in New Guinea and Australia persist, even today. “The New Guinean fauna is fascinating,” Flinders paleontology Ph.D. candidate Isaac Kerr <a href=# rel=noopener>told Phys.org</a>.</p><p>“There are several species of large, long-nosed, worm-eating echidna that are still around today, many different wallaby and possum species that we don’t get in Australia, and more still in the fossil record. We think of these animals as being uniquely Australian, but they have this intriguing other life within New Guinea.”</p><p>When Nombe nombe branched off from the kangaroos in Australia, it evolved in ways to better survive its new, tropical mountain home. It evolved a powerful jaw and facial muscles to feast on the land’s tough shrubs and leaves.</p><p>Nombe nombe was also likely squat and muscular — but little else is known about its habitat or behaviors, or how comparable it was to the extinct mega-kangaroo Protemnodon from Australia.</p><p>This beast is thought to have looked like a modern-day wallaby, but it was altogether larger. The smallest in the genus weighed in at about 100 pounds while the largest was probably around 400 pounds. Whether the Nombe nombe was anything like the wallaby or hopped like modern kangaroos remains unknown.</p><p>Additionally, why these creatures went extinct at all remains a mystery.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-385319 alt="Papua New Guinean Megafauna" width=700 height=467 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/papua-new-guinean-megafauna.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-385319 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Illustration by Peter Schouten</span><span class=caption-body>A depiction of prehistoric Papua New Guinea’s flora and megafauna.</span></p><p>Of course, as with any prehistoric discovery, more questions than answers have arisen. As such, the team from Flinders University will return to Papua New Guinea for further excavations next year.</p><p>“We’re very excited to undertake three paleontological digs at two different sites in eastern and central PNG over the next three years,” reports co-author and Flinders University Professor Gavin Prideaux to <a href=# rel=noopener>Eureakalert</a>.</p><p>Kerr is optimistic that this upcoming research will “breathe some new life into paleontology in New Guinea” and that “there may even be a complete skeleton of Nombe nombe waiting for us.”</p><p>For more news out of prehistory, check out the mind-boggling discovery of a 95-million-year-old <a href=#>crocodile found with a dinosaur still in its belly</a>.
