While the prerequisites to what makes a game “hip-hop” have always been broad, they’ve been apparent. Sometimes all it took was a <a href=# rel>banging soundtrack and a counterculture attitude</a>. In some cases, actual rappers, producers, and other artists were integral to specific titles’ very existence. &nbsp;But this has never been a necessity. Some games were born with a hip-hop attitude, borrowing from various music, cultures, and iconography. Let’s look at five standout titles that are undeniably hip-hop.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-dj-hero-2009>5. DJ Hero (2009)</h2></span><p>FreeStyleGames’ DJ Hero was a music game that rode the wave crest of titles like Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Players would use a plastic turntable and mixer to cut and scratch two tracks to beat each level. The game was an odd duck, even in video games requiring unique controller peripherals.</p><p>With its <a href=# rel>massive soundtrack</a> of hip-hop and house tracks, DJ Hero made players feel like they were really on the 1s and 2s. It was the closest you could be to DJ’ing a house party from the confines of a bedroom. The game was a moderate hit and spawned a sequel in 2010. Unfortunately, the franchise died as it never really found the broad appeal that games like Rock Band had.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-marc-ecko-s-getting-up-contents-under-pressure-2006>4. Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure (2006)</h2></span><p>Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure was a game that defied genres. The game utilized elements of stealth action games, beat ‘em up brawlers, platformers, and graffiti simulators. Its unique gameplay, advanced graphics (for the time), and the incredible soundtrack by RJD2 made it a defining entry in hip-hop video game canon.</p><p>Developer The Collective had previously created primarily licensed video game tie-ins, like Men in Black: <a href=# class=text-word rel>The Game</a>. However, Marc Ecko's Getting Up: Contents Under Pressure proved the studio was capable of much more. Unfortunately, The Collective would never get a chance to develop something as unique again. The Collective became defunct shortly after the game’s release.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-nba-street-vol-2-2003>3. NBA Street Vol. 2 (2003)</h2></span><p>Despite their popularity, most annual sports video games tend to be improved replications of previous releases. To be fair, the same could be said for game franchises like Call of Duty and Assassins’ Creed. The repetition could grow stale for some gamers. That’s why a series like NBA Street was such a breath of fresh air. NBA Street Vol. 2 was one of the best examples of a game genre breaking its mold. Developers NuFX and EA Canada crafted a unique vision of what a basketball game could be. The rules were stripped down, the aesthetics were raw, and the soundtrack was fire. NBA Street Vol 2. might’ve been the most hip-hop a sports game could be.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-def-jam-fight-for-ny-2004>2. Def Jam: Fight for NY (2004)</h2></span><p>Def Jam: Fight for NY was the sequel to the popular hip-hop wrestling game Def Jam: Vendetta. Fight for NY expanded the scope of its predecessor, turning into an action game by incorporating more open environments and various fighting styles for players to choose from. The story of the game was a convoluted crime saga.</p><p>Players would take control of a nameless hero as they fought through the New York Underground. A massive roster of rappers and producers appeared in the game, and famous clothing lines from the period were omnipresent. Throw in a soundtrack featuring artists like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Xzibit</a>, <a href=# class=text-word rel>OutKast</a>, and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Redman</a>, and you got an all-time hip-hop video game classic. Fight for NY was followed by Def Jam: Icon in 2007. However, it didn’t quite clear the high bar set in place by its predecessor.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-jet-set-radio-2000>1. Jet Set Radio (2000)</h2></span><p>Jet Set Radio (also known as Jet Grind Radio in North America) was another game that shook video game conventions. The game followed a gang of graffiti-tagging inline skaters. Players would control various characters as they tried to paint over tags from rival gangs before the timer ran out.</p><p>At its release, the closest relative to Jet Set Radio would have been Tony Hawk Pro Skater, but even that wasn’t an apt comparison. Japanese Developer Smilebit had created something wholly original. The game featured an insane soundtrack filled with hip-hop, techno, and trip-hop tracks. The art style was wild, and the game’s counter-culture attitude was omnipresent.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbIRxf5BmmZ6rpGK1qryMoaapZaaesaa7jKCYpp2j</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
