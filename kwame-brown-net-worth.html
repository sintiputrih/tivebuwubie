Authoritative sources have estimated that the total size of Brown’s net worth is equal to $30 million, with the main source of this sum of money being his professional career as an NBA player.<br>[divider]</p><h3>Kwame Brown Net Worth $30 Million</h3><p>[divider]<br>Kwame Brown spent his childhood with his six brothers in Brunswick, Georgia. He started playing basketball in 5th grade at St. Simons Island Elementary, and then when he continued his education at Glynn Academy, where he became one of the best high school players. Thus, as a senior, Brown was named the high school player of the year, as he set school records – 1,235 rebounds and 605 blocked shots. He was also named in 2001 to the McDonald’s All American Team.</p><p>Immediately after matriculation from high school, Brown decided to enter the NBA Draft, and as a result, he was selected as the 1st overall pick by the Washington Wizards. At the time, the president of the Wizards was <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>, who thought that Brown would be a great selection for the team, however, he proved differently, as he only averaged 4.5 points and 3.5 rebounds per game.Nevertheless, in the following years, Brown’s numbers improved, and he was offered a five-year deal worth $30 million; however, he rejected it, as he wanted to try as a free agent. Anyway, Brown soon got into arguments with coach and players, and was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, alongside Laron Profit, in exchange for<a href=#> Caron Butler</a> and Chucky Atkins.</p><p>He spent three years in the Los Angeles Lakers, but he still couldn’t live up to his full potential, averaging only 7.5 points, and 6.3 rebounds, so he was then traded to the Memphis Grizzlies who didn’t renew his contract, and he became a free agent.</p><p>Brown then signed a two-year contract with the Detroit Pistons worth $8 million, which increased his net worth by a large margin. Before he retired, Brown also played for the Charlotte Bobcats, and Golden State Warriors, with whom he signed a one year deal worth $7 million, increasing further his net worth, and then for the Philadelphia 76ers, with whom he had a two-year deal worth $6 million, but after several injuries, the 76ers waived him in November of 2013-2014 season, marking the end of his professional career. When it comes to Kwame Brown’s personal life, there is no information in the media about his life off the court, as he obviously keeps it very private.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.418786692759><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Kwame Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$30 Million</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Salary</td><td>$2.819 million USD (2013)</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 10, 1982</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Charleston, South Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>2.11</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>131.54</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>Retired basketball player</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of Georgia, Glynn Academy</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Joyce Brown, Willie James Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Akeem Brown</td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm3021344</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>NBA draft: 2001, Washington Wizards (Round: 1 / Pick: 1), 2001 McDonald's All-American Team</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>TV Shows</td><td>Phoenix Suns (Lakers seven-game series)</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqSumqWVYq%2Bzu9anZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
