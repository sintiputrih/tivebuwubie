After all, fans want to know things about <a href=#>Swift's relationship with her parents</a>, what <a href=#>her most successful songs</a> are, and <a href=#>how she is getting richer</a>. Of course, Swift's fans also like reports about her love life including articles about <a href=#>which of her exes is the oldest</a>.</p><p>Even after Swift breaks up with someone, many of her fans are still so invested that they continue to talk about her exes. A perfect example of that is the fact that some of her fans believe <a href=#><strong>Joe Alwyn</strong></a> was snubbed because of his breakup with Swift.</p><p>This article will reveal why some <strong>Taylor Swift fans think Joe Alwyn was snubbed after their breakup</strong>. Then, the article will look at why it seems likely that <strong>the idea that Alwyn was being snubbed could be overstated</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-alwyn-39-s-co-stars-seemed-to-snub-him-after-his-split-with-taylor-swift>Joe Alwyn's Co-Stars Seemed To Snub Him After His Split With Taylor Swift</h2><p>For many Taylor Swift fans, Joe Alwyn is best known as the pop music superstar's ex-boyfriend. However, it should be remembered that Alwyn is an actor who has worked with many celebrities, including Emma Stone.</p><p>After previously working with Stone on The Favourite, Alwyn co-starred with her again in the 2024 absurdist dark comedy Kinds of Kindness. In May 2024, Kinds of Kindness' cast and its director, Yorgos Lanthimos, were promoting the film.</p><p>According to a report from The Daily Mail at that time, it seemed like <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alwyn was distant from his co-stars and Lanthimos</a></strong> during the promotional tour. The fan theory at the time was that <strong>Alwyn was being snubbed because of his breakup with Taylor Swift</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/joe-alwyn-hong-chau-willem-dafoe-emma-stone-and-yorgos-lanthimos.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reason why some onlookers believed that Alwyn was being snubbed by the team behind Kinds of Kindness was three-fold. Taken together, it is pretty easy to see why some onlookers would draw conclusions.</p><p>When and where was Joe Alwyn born, according to Famous Birthdays?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Where was Joe Alwyn born?:</p></td><td><p>London, England</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When was Joe Alwyn born?:</p></td><td><p>February 21, 1991</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How old is Joe Alwyn as of May, 2024</p></td><td><p>33 years old</p></td></tr></tbody></table><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-kelce-continues-to-come-clean_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce Continues To Come Clean About If He Actually Likes Taylor Swift's Music">Travis Kelce Continues To Come Clean About If He Actually Likes Taylor Swift's Music</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's fans want to know if Travis Kelce really likes his girlfriend's music.</p><p>First off, The Daily Mail's report pointed to the dynamic between Alwyn and the rest of Kinds of Kindness' creative team at Cannes. According to the outlet, <strong>Alwyn seemed "glum"</strong> during a press conference and photocall <strong>while everyone else appeared happy</strong>.</p><p>The outlet also pointed to photos from the event of Hong Chau, Willem Dafoe, Stone, and Yorgos Lanthimos smiling alongside a dour-looking Alwyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/why-joe-alwyn-s-mysterious-parents-were-almost-never-spotted-anywhere-near-taylor-swift-front-back-deposit.jpg><p>Secondly, The Daily Mail also reported that <strong>Alwyn didn't show up at a Kinds of Kindness cast gathering</strong> that Lanthimos attended. According to The Daily Mail, a small party for the cast and crew was thrown at The Carlton Hotel after the press conference and photocall.</p><p>While Kinds of Kindness' other stars all attended the party at The Carlton Hotel, Alwyn reportedly went to a different party. The Daily Mail reported that Alwyn went to the Charles Finch filmmakers dinner which was also attended by Barbie's director Greta Gerwig.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/pressure-mounts-on-travis-kelce-to-propose-to-taylor-swift_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Pressure Mounts On Travis Kelce To Propose To Taylor Swift As Her Eras Tour Set Changes">Pressure Mounts On Travis Kelce To Propose To Taylor Swift As Her Eras Tour Set Changes</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's fans and other observers have been expecting Travis Kelce to propose to Taylor Swift very soon as her Eras tour changes.</p><p>Finally, the third element that made fans think that Alwyn had been snubbed didn't actually involve him at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Long before Alwyn and Taylor Swift dated, the pop star built a friendship with Emma Stone. While they rarely speak out about their bond, in 2023 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Stone spoke about her long friendship with Swift</strong></a> while explaining how she got to see the Eras tour live.</p><p>“I was lucky ’cause we’ve been friends for a really long time. I’ve known her since we were 17 and 18, so she hooked me up, which was very nice ’cause I know those tickets are impossible to get.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/taylor-swift-and-emma-stone-s-friendship.jpg><p>Between reports that Alwyn seemed distant from his co-stars and didn't party with them, that certainly points to some drama. When you factor in Emma Stone's close relationship with Taylor Swift and Alwyn's recent split from the pop star, that seems like a possible explanation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, before fans take that theory for true, it is important to note the evidence that paints a different picture.</p><h2 id=why-the-theory-about-joe-alwyn-being-snubbed-is-likely-overstated>Why The Theory About Joe Alwyn Being Snubbed Is Likely Overstated</h2><p>Unless, Joe Alwyn, Emma Stone, or someone else involved directly comments on the theory, there is no way to know for sure if his co-stars were snubbing him. That said, there is evidence that makes it seem <strong>very likely that claims Alwyn was subbed are overstated at least</strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ttweb_sophie-turner-revealed-what-she-hated-about-being-joe-jonas-wife-and-how-taylor-swift-helped-her-survive-her-divorce_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Sophie Turner Revealed What She Hated About Being Joe Jonas' Wife And How Taylor Swift Helped Her Survive Her Divorce">Sophie Turner Revealed What She Hated About Being Joe Jonas' Wife And How Taylor Swift Helped Her Survive Her Divorce</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Sophie Turner revealed she hated how people spoke about her during her marriage to Joe Jonas.</p><p>While looking at the evidence that makes it seem possible that Alwyn was snubbed, some of it doesn't paint the whole picture. One example of that is that there is footage of <strong>Alwyn and his Kinds of Kindness co-stars looking like they were getting along</strong>.</p><p>In May 2024, Access Hollywood published footage of Kinds of Kindness' cast on the Cannes red carpet together. Some of that footage shows <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alwyn with a smile on his face beside his co-stars</a></strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An X account dedicated to Emma Stone also published footage of her and Alwyn talking to each other at Cannes. While the post doesn't reveal what she was saying, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stone seemed to be having a friendly conversation with Alwyn</a></strong> in the footage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/emma-stone-and-joe-alwyn-smiling-together.jpg><p>Finally, since the theory is that Alwyn was snubbed because of Emma Stone and Taylor Swift's relationship, there is a very revealing quote to consider. In May 2024, Yahoo! News quoted a Kinds of Kindness press release that featured <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stone talking about how much she likes Alwyn</a></strong>.</p><p>"I love Joe. We had to do some pretty dark stuff on this one, so it was extremely comforting to be with him because he’s one of the sweetest people you’ll ever meet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If Stone wanted nothing to do with Alwyn because of his split from Swift, it seems very unlikely that quote would have been published.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ1dlrm4xc1mqqetkpeypXnTmrClp6JiwLi1xa1km6qVlrhuwc9moqKmlKh6sLKMpKCnnJ6awLR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
