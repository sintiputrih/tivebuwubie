Alan Bersten’s Parents’ Age Difference</span></h2><p>Alan Bersten is Raisa Bersten’s and Alex Bersten’s son. On May 26, 1992, in Minnetonka, Minnesota, the lovely dancer was born. His two siblings were Gene, his brother, and Dr. Melani, his sister. He is the Berstens’ youngest child. The attractive dancer is of mixed ethnicity due to his Russian parentage.</p><p>His brother Gene is a dancer who debuted in SYTUCD S10. He was Alen’s first dance instructor, as well as a role model for his brother and parents, whom he credits with his success. His mother, Raisa, works at Abbott Northwestern Hospital.
