"There's no time for that."</p><p id=erWB88cYTEIu data-wc=35>Mr Scobie told : "It would have been nice to see them come together on certain projects perhaps in the early years, to put on that united front, but they’re all working in silos."</p><h2>Different approaches between the Palace and Prince William</h2><p id=ebV5zNCi8Q data-wc=73>It's been reported that Prince William was "furious" when his godmother <a class=hm-link href=#>Lady Susan Hussey was embroiled in a race row</a> at Buckingham Palace. According to the book, William William "needed to distance himself" from the incident - and took a different approach to the Palace. A Palace source told the book: "It was a rash . . . knee-jerk response. The feeling was they wanted to disassociate, instead of thinking as a team."</p><p id=e2hzMnKKeR data-wc=41>At the time, a Kensington Palace spokesman said: "This is a matter for Buckingham Palace but as the Prince of Wales spokesperson I appreciate you're all here and understand you'll want to ask about it. So let me address it head-on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8b9a4993971c-prince-william-serious.jpg><p id=eMUPrmTYDa data-wc=69>"I was really disappointed to hear about the guests' experience at Buckingham Palace last night. Obviously, I wasn't there, but racism has no place in our society. The comments were unacceptable, and it is right that individual has stepped aside with immediate effect." Omid went on to describe the actions as a "swift rebuke and a remarkably different PR response to what we've come to expect from the Palace".</p><h2><strong>William ignored texts from Harry before the Queen's death</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a8532507c4b2-gettyimages-1425261876.jpg><p id=eDTi_Bb0T_vB data-wc=17>The book claims to recount Harry's experience on the day his late grandmother Queen Elizabeth II died.</p><p id=ezTQc5zA0bhU data-wc=23>It claims that William did not respond to Harry's texts as he tried to arrange a flight to Balmoral in Scotland from London.</p><p id=e7N3TK3voZLs data-wc=21>“It was upsetting to witness,” a source close to the Sussexes told&nbsp;Mr&nbsp;Scobie. “(Harry) was completely by himself on this.”</p><p id=eBS5P0VcP_gG data-wc=28>The Queen died at 3.10pm on 8 September 2022. Harry flew separately to Balmoral from William and other members of his family, with his flight leaving at 5.35pm.</p><p id=e5znkkgw5nGC data-wc=20>The news of the late Queen's death was announced by Buckingham Palace at 6.30pm while he was in the air.</p><h2>Princess Anne persuaded King Charles to evict the Sussexes from Frogmore Cottage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/157d01356455-princess-anne-at-ascot.jpg><p id=ejAZ0EYYEema data-wc=20>It is claimed that the Princess Royal "persuaded Charles to withdraw the use of Frogmore Cottage" from Harry and Meghan.</p><p id=eM9QXHnN2aw4 data-wc=12>The Duke and Duchess officially vacated their Windsor abode earlier this year.</p><p id=etkM8BfK0TsN data-wc=33>The Sussexes moved into the Grade-II listed property before Archie's birth in May 2019, living there for just six months&nbsp;before announcing their decision to leave the UK for a new life overseas.</p><p id=enZZZA9JdIIf data-wc=22>Harry and Meghan had kept&nbsp;Frogmore&nbsp;Cottage as their UK base up until July 2023, and had repaid the cost of renovations.</p><h2>Prince Harry and King Charles spoke days after the release of Spare</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a396531ebf58-spare-book-cover-z.jpg><p id=eHNH3TtDmD data-wc=26>According to the book, the Duke and his father had their first proper conversation after the release of Harry's tell-all memoir, Spare, on 10 January 2023.&nbsp;</p><p id=enB50c7x0n data-wc=13>Harry was reportedly encouraged by a close friend to reach out to Charles.&nbsp;</p><p id=eDijZwlX42 data-wc=53>A friend of the Duke told Mr Scobie: "It was an awkward conversation, but he knew if he didn’t make those first steps, there would never be any progress. There were no raised voices, no arguments . . . but the King was cold and brief rather than open to any proper dialogue."</p><h2><strong>Meghan keeps in touch with King Charles</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4620f8cb8012-gettyimages-961424764.jpg><p id=ea-dNYt_SSBk data-wc=20>claims that the Duchess remains in touch with the King, sending him photographs of his grandchildren, Archie and Lilibet.</p><p id=eqp4Jn6p_bkv data-wc=28>When the King celebrated his 75th birthday earlier this month, Harry and Meghan reportedly <a class=hm-link href=#>recorded a sweet video of Archie and Lilibet</a> singing Happy Birthday to their grandfather.</p><h2><strong>Prince William's Earthshot Prize marred by Harry & Meghan trailer</strong></h2><p id=eQO0CFTD8- data-wc=46>&nbsp;In 2022, there was much talk about Prince William's star-studded Earthshot Prize ceremony, which he attended alongside his wife Kate. However, according to Omid, Netflix deliberately released the first bombshell trailer for Prince Harry and Megan's intimate Netflix series, Harry & Meghan, on the same day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b20c8e02818f-shutterstockeditorial13646664at.jpg><p id=e9x-PsrJhQ data-wc=35>"Despite the promotional efforts and high expectations, the awards ceremony, by most accounts, didn't make the playoffs, let alone the Super Bowl," he wrote. "There was, however, halftime show entertainment courtesy of another royal couple.&nbsp;</p><p id=emCgz0rswm data-wc=42>"The first trailer for the Sussexes’ intimate Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan, released that same day (an intentional move by the streamer, I'm told), promising the "full truth" behind the couple's departure."
