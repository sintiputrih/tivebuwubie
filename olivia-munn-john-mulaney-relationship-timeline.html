It was kind of strange," she said. "I didn't think anybody believed it until my family started texting me. My sister said, 'This is so stupid. Why would anybody think this? You're not engaged, it's so stupid.' And then the next text after that was, 'But seriously, are you engaged because I'm like seeing it everywhere?'"</p><h2>Are Olivia Munn and John Mulaney engaged?</h2><p id=eGankie73EtQ data-wc=26>The actress and comedian duo are not currently engaged.
