Later on, this comic series was renamed More Fun Comics.</p><p>Unlike other publishing companies, this one specialized in superhero comic books. The franchise’s founder launched his Detective Comic in 1937, which went on to become the longest-running comic series of all time and was the inspiration for the company’s name. Another anthology, Action Comics, was published in 1938, ushering in a new decade of superhero comic books.</p><p>The franchise has also pioneered new creative concepts in comic books, which have been enormously successful and well-received by fans worldwide.

After the popularity of superheroes waned in the 1940s, the company shifted its emphasis to other genres such as romance, science fiction, westerns, and comedy.</p><p>Later, in superheroes such as Justice League, a new and intriguing concept of character association was introduced. During this time, the franchise faced a major rival in the form of Marvel Comics.</p><p>Since then, the publishing house has worked hard to introduce a slew of new and innovative comic books.
