Katz previously told HollywoodLife that sheâ€™s definitely gotten her lips injected in the last few months.</p><p>â€˜She might have had something injected called Juvederm Volbella or Restylane Silk which is the other lip filler that is quite often used. No question about it, sheâ€™s had a lot of filler injected,â€™ the specialist assured the news outlet during the interview.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about Khloeâ€™s latest pic?
