Moreover, with Alex stepping into the reality TV scene, it’s possible that the two might have connected at some point.</span></p><p><span>In March 2023, right after Tom Schwartz, was spotted filming </span><i><span>Vanderpump Rules </span></i><span>season 3, his ex-wife Katie Maloney publicly drooled over Alex Propson. “Excuse me?!?!” Maloney commented on a shirtless photo of Alex Propson, which was posted by the fan account @</span><a href=#><span>bravobygays.</span></a></p><p><span>The post read, “BY THE TIME WINTER HOUSE S3 AIRS, @alexpropson WILL NO LONGER BE A NEWBIE AND WE WILL HAVE ALREADY SEEN HIM ON OUR SCREENS!
