In 2002, the Latin Recording Academy recognized Fernandez as Person of the Year. He also has a star placed with his name at the walk of fame in Hollywood, California.&nbsp;Nicknamed as “El Rey de la Cancion Ranchera” (The King of Ranchera Music) throughout the Hispanosphere, Fernández started his career singing for tips on the street, and has since become a cultural icon, recording more than 50 albums and contributing to more than 30 films.
