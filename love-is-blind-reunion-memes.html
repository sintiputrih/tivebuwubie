From people wanting only the best for Kenny to Amber's beef with Jessica, these memes encapsulated the best moments from the reunion special.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. To no one's surprise, everyone was obsessed with Lauren on the show.</h2><p>The undeniable fan favorite couple on Love Is Blind was Lauren and Cameron. They were the first couple to get engaged (in Episode 1 no less) and they were both captivated by one another as soon as they met in person.&nbsp;</p><p>During the reunion, multiple men on the show revealed that they also had strong relationships with Lauren before Cameron got down on one knee. Damian and Kenny admitted that they both found Lauren to be a knockout once they saw her in person.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kenny: omg Me and Lauren went on a couple dates and she’s captivating I mean she’s stunning.</p><p>Damien: Me and Lauren dated every single day up until the engagements and we laughed so much</p><p>Cam:<a href=#>#LoveIsBlindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/5zWSUynkTZ</a></p>— Lexi🌼 (@Lexi52994) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How Cameron was looking while Damian was talking about Lauren <a href=#>#loveisblindreunion</a> <a href=#>#loveisblind</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hRyRR8qBHf</a></p>— JusticeCullins (@CullinsJustice) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a><a href=#>#LoveIsBlind</a></p><p>Damien: Lauren and I dated every day until the engagements😍 we laughed so much..our Star Wars joke were everything🥺</p><p>Kenny: SHHESSH..Lauren is so captivating.🤤.I mean just stunning😘</p><p>Cameron: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Q6AbN8CAgY</a></p>— Naturally A Saint😇 (@NaturallyaSaint) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>LAUREN dated DAMIAN right up until her ENGAGEMENT?!!! <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>#loveisblindnetflix</a> <a href=#>#loveisblind</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ksxHyvpcmq</a></p>— A Girl Has No Name (@AryaStans) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Viewers wanted the entire reunion to be about Cameron and Lauren.</h2><p>There was a lot that needed to be discussed on the reunion, but people were confused as to why Lauren and Cameron didn't get more screen time. They were everyone's favorite couple, but viewers only got a few updates about their post-marriage life.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cameron & Lauren carried this entire show on their necks for 10 episodes straight and all they get is 5 minutes of this reunion?! <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/nHGybjhxC5</a></p>— 👑Drey🇨🇩 (@nyotasmiles_) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wonder if Lauren and Cam’s backs hurt from carrying this damn show on their backs... <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mlktECX5aa</a></p>— Nikki ✨ (@keepnupwitnikki) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Lauren and Cam carried the whole show and getting only 5 minutes?! <a href=#>#LoveIsBlind</a> <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7LlinN6tdd</a></p>— Ricardo Berlakovich (@RicBerlakovich) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>When you're so perfect as a couple you even cringe together perfectly<a href=#>#LoveIsBlind</a> <a href=#>#LoveIsBlindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EpbwfUC4J6</a></p>— bishcheese (@bishcheese) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Mark clearly didn't watch the show because it seems like he'd take Jessica back.</h2><p>It was clear to viewers from the start that Jessica was not that into Mark, but we hoped his desperate attempts to hold onto the relationship were really just a result of good editing. Alas, during the reunion, Mark said a few things that implied that he might be interested in reconciling with his ex. Either he didn't watch the same show as the rest of the world, or he's really hoping that she'll finally make him that Italian beef.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My favorite love is blind meme <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CJ2c2Sw27T</a></p>— 🐇💮 (@seokoholic) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Mark low key would give Jessica another chance and it baffles me <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/x09q1GIMFZ</a></p>— Elevate and find (@Walkingalchemy) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wanted Mark to have Kenny’s energy for the reunion.

No matter what she says, Jessica is still into Barnett.</h2><p>Though Jessica tried to blame her flirtatious and inappropriate behavior at Barnett's birthday party on being over-served whiskey, everyone (including her castmates) could tell that Jessica would have ended things with Mark in a heartbeat if Barnett wanted to get together with her.&nbsp;</p><p>Amber did call Jessica out for stepping over the line, and she went as far as to call her "shiesty" and fake. Viewers were living for Amber's words toward Jessica, and many thought Jessica looked terrified. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jessica hearing that Amber and Barnett almost got a divorce but ended up working things out <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TvyMXWRE7U</a></p>— Ana.

She admitted that she considered getting a divorce lawyer at one point, but that the two had since figured out how to live together happily. Of course, many Twitter users took that admission to be an open door for Jessica.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jessica when Amber said the word “divorce” <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EoQrk4gyl8</a></p>— t. pleasure (@taylorzapataa) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Nobody was buying Amber's statement about being fully independent.</h2><p>Out of all of the moments that viewers got to see from the couples, Amber was often the most vulnerable. While in the pods, Amber admitted that she had an abortion after her ex-boyfriend pressured her into getting one.&nbsp;</p><p>When she toured Barnett's Atlanta house after their engagement, Amber admitted that she was in debt from attending college, that she only had one credit card (which was exclusively for makeup), and that she didn't like to work.&nbsp;</p><p>On the reunion, Amber defended this conversation and assured viewers that she was not financially dependent on Barnett.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a><br>Amber: I've never been financially dependent on anyone before</p><p>Us: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/xcT6eWYrOY</a></p>— ThatCommonChick (@TheCommonChick1) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love Amber but she came on the show basically jobless and homeless and was surprised she ended up being financially dependent on Barnett????

Viewers were more than happy for Kenny and his new girlfriend.</h2><p>When Vanessa and Nick Lachey asked for a show of hands as to who was in a relationship during the reunion, there was an odd number. That's because Kenny is happily in a relationship more than a year after Kelly left him at the altar. But, Kelly also revealed that she wanted to continue to date Kenny.</p><p>Many were thrilled for Kenny, and others hoped that Kelly was feeling regret for letting such a good guy go.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>kelly regretting her decision and her whole family supporting kenny but now he’s dating someone else 😌 sounds like karma <a href=#>#loveisblindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1awclTrhiw</a></p>— ✨ (@avonleatimes) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kelly listening to Kenny talk about his new relationship like <a href=#>#LoveIsBlind</a> <a href=#>#LoveIsBlindReunion</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kb6vzI2nhH</a></p>— Jessay #pumprules (@jessay) <a href=#>March 5, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Listen to what Kelly said SHE WANTED TO CONTINUE DATING AND THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

Nobody knew how to feel about Carlton and Diamond's exchange.</h2><p>Carlton and Diamond walked so Giannina and Damian could run in the breakup department. From the moment Carlton and Diamond met, it was clear that things were not going to end well for them. For starters, Carlton hadn't told Diamond about being bisexual yet, which ultimately made Diamond feel like he hadn't been fully open in the pods. When they broke up, Diamond's engagement ring was thrown in the pool, Diamond quoted Beyonce, and Carlton made fun of her wig.&nbsp;</p><p>On the reunion, the two seemed to patch things up. Carlton explained that he didn't ever think that Diamond was biphobic and that he was wrong for going off on her in the way that he did. For her part, Diamond said that she was just caught off guard with Carlton's announcement.&nbsp;</p><p>While some found Carlton's friendship proposal (with the ring retrieved from the pool) to be a nice moment, others found it to be too contrived.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Me when Carlton was trying to gaslight Diamond.
