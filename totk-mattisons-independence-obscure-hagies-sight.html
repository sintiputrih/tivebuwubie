And, most importantly, to restrain from speaking to voe (boys). Given that her mom and dad are rather busy, they don’t have much time for her. Hence, they will kindly ask you to make sure she has a great time on her last day in Tarrey Town. The first part of the TOTK “Mattison’s Independence” quest is participating in the Gerudo Quiz. You will be asked what’s the correct Gerudo word for “Granny”. Here are the possible answers:</p>';document.getElementById("serge_5f895c6208f81a315320ec57").style.display = "block"; }<ul><li>Vava</li><li>Vada</li><li><strong>Vaba – This is the Correct Answer!</strong></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/05/Zelda-TOTK-Mattisons-Independence-Obscure-Hagies-Sight-640x360.webp><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/05/Zelda-TOTK-Mattisons-Independence-granny-250x140.webp><h2>How to Obscure Hagie’s Line of Sight in TOTK – How to get Mattison on the Rail Car</h2><p>For her next activity, Mattison will want to visit her dad at the job site. In order to reach the location, she will need to use the town’s railcar. However, Hagie, the railcar manager, wants her to pay for the ride just like everyone else. To be frank, we’re not sure why we can not simply pay for her ride. Nevertheless, she wants to try to hop aboard the railcar without him noticing, thus evading the payment. She will subtly ask Link to “maybe cover his eyes”. So, how to obscure Hagie’s line of sight in Zelda TOTK? This quest is not perfectly obvious, and many players were stuck trying to complete it. We’ve managed to do it with a nearby wooden platform. However, the better and intended way is to open the stuck Storehouse door and use Hudson Cutouts stored inside.</p><p>What you need to do is to position <a href=#>Hudson Cutouts</a> with your Ultrahand somewhere between Hagie and the railcar in a way that they are blocking his view of the railcar. It will require some trial and error until you find the perfect spot. However, when you find the right angle, Hagie will say, “It’s blocking my view”. That’s when you leave the barrier and head back to talk with Mattison. Tell her that she can go now! A cutscene will start with her happily riding down the cliff in a railcar toward her father’s construction site.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/05/Zelda-TOTK-Mattisons-Independence-granny-gerudo-250x140.webp><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/05/Zelda-TOTK-Obscure-Hagies-Sight-250x140.webp><h2>Where to Find 10 Sundelions for Mattison’s Independence Quest in Zelda Tears of the Kingdom</h2><p>Finally, for the last task in this questline, President Hudson wants to dye Mattison’s balloon yellow to resemble the Sun. For that, he will need 10 Sundelions. It’s a rather straightforward task if you know where to look. The Sundelion flower grows only near Zonai ruins. Hence, your best bet is to activate the nearby Ulri Mountain Skyview Tower, propel yourself into the sky, and land on any nearby sky island. When you have 10 of them, head back to President Hudson and Mattison. And with that, the “Mattison’s Independence” quest is completed! Do not refuse their offer to take a ride with the new balloon, you will have a beautiful cutscene with the Hudson family!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/05/Zelda-TOTK-Block-Hagies-View-250x140.webp><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/05/Zelda-TOTK-Mattisons-help-250x140.webp><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jrOcpZyRYsGmrdGsZKieXam1pnnKoqWdp51kwbDAymakmqyknsCwutJmoKeclaWyr7DEp5qeZZ%2BXwKTB0Z5koZmXnrK0edKinqGsXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
