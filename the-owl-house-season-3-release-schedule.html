The Owl House made Disney history by being the first show featuring a bisexual lead character, which led to the news of its cancelation being met with extreme disappointment. To soften the blow, however, Disney greenlit a compact version of the show’s third season, allowing its creator, Dana Terrace, to at least wrap up the story with three 44-minute special episodes.</p><h2 id=h-the-owl-house-season-3-episodes data-injectable=false>The Owl House season 3 episodes</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>Season three’s much-anticipated premiere episode, “Thanks to Them,” aired on the Disney Channel on Oct. 15, 2022, and was later released on Disney Plus. After three months of waiting, fans saw the second episode, titled “For the Future,” air on Jan. 21, giving the audience a glimpse of what has become of the Boiling Isles since the Collector took control. Those who missed the episode on Disney Channel will be able to stream it on Disney Plus starting Feb. 8.</p><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=385 data-injectable=false>As for the third and final episode, “Watching and Dreaming,” unfortunately there is currently no word from Disney regarding a release date. Considering the time between the releases of episodes one and two, it might be safe for viewers to set their sights on an April or May premiere. This is merely speculation, though, so fans will have to await an official confirmation.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=491 data-injectable=false>Until the time comes, fans can rewatch The Owl House‘s previous seasons on Disney Now and Disney XD.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmprCkXZ28tr%2FEZqqemaOku25%2FjKucpZ2RqLJuv8KhnJ2tnJp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
