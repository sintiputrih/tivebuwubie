And he’s coming here soon, so hopefully we can work out a plan to see one another while he’s over here. As of right now, we’re keeping it pretty real with each other. He’s in Australia and we’ve known each other a week. We’re in communication and hoping to find some sort of plan to see each other when he does get here.”</p><p data-characters=82 data-current-count=82 data-injectable=false>To follow Emily’s statement, Harrison had some very similar insight to give:</p><p>“I wouldn’t say it’s love just yet… it’s early stages, but you click with people for a reason. Who’s to say it won’t go in that direction? We’ve already spoken multiple times since we’ve been back, and we got to go out for dinner the night we left, and so it was really nice being able to leave with her. Although, unfortunately, I feel like I kind of cut her experience short a little bit. The reality of it is that I clicked with Emily better than I did with anyone else in the villa.”</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=214 data-injectable=false>While things seemed to be smooth sailing between Emily and Harrison as soon as they left the villa, a different islander seems to have caught Emily’s eye, one of whom she never got to meet back in Fiji…</p><h2 id=h-which-islander-is-emily-chavez-pursuing data-injectable=false>Which islander is Emily Chavez pursuing?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>https://www.tiktok.com/@emiillyelliizabeth/video/7271709244116716843</figure><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>There’s no telling whether or not Emily and Harrison have been keeping in touch since being dumped from the villa (despite what they told Collider), however, we know one thing for certain: she has been spending quite a bit of time with fellow islander <strong>Mike Stark</strong>.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>Yesterday (August 26), Emily took to TikTok (where she has amassed nearly 300k followers) to share a video of her and Mike. The duo was pictured sitting in what appeared to be someone’s bedroom, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snoop Dogg</a>‘s “Sensual Seduction” playing in the background – it seems like it may be more than just a friendship if you ask us…</p><p data-characters=97 data-current-count=97 data-injectable=false>Fans of Love Island: USA flooded Emily’s comment section, stunned at this unsuspecting duo:</p><p>“WHATTT wait I love this,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@rainafawcett</a> wrote.</p><p>“WHAAAAAAAT DOES THIS MEAN,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@georgannapaislee</a> wrote.</p><p>“I knewwwww itttttttttt the minute I saw y’all were both from houston AND I LOVE IT,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@earth2abc</a> wrote.</p><p>“OKAY PLOT TWIST,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@lauradilts</a> wrote.</p><p>“Umm so you’re just going to leave us on a cliffhanger,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">@natty.20200</a> wrote.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=336 data-injectable=false>Given that both Emily and Mike live in Houston, Texas, it is no surprise that they connected beyond the villa. According to their Instagram stories, it appears that the pair went to dinner yesterday, and they even met up with Love Island: USA couple Vickala “Kay Kay” Gray and Keenan Anunay – that seems like a double date to us!</p><p data-characters=318 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>While Emily and Mike have been getting nice and cozy with one another,&nbsp;despite never being in the villa at the same time on Love Island: USA, it is unclear if Emily is still in touch with her original man across the pond. Who knows, Emily and Mike could be just trolling&nbsp;fans of the show for attention…</p><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=139 data-injectable=false>To watch the rest of Love Island: USA unfold, tune into the finale of season 5&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">at 9pm ET/6pm PT</a>&nbsp;on Peacock to see which couple will win.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ywt8CyZKmkn6l6tcPIrKtmoaNisq61y7JknKCRq7K7ec%2BuqaytmaO0bq3NqKuhnaJitrS4wKebnqpdl7K0tcOeqmagkae%2Fqr%2FOp2SlrZ6WeqKy056pZpqVnruoecSloKahnpbBprCMn6mopV2hvLexjKKqpZmemXq2v8Bo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
