She has kept some of his objects, including a painting of two young Egyptian boys that hangs in her bedroom and a life-size sculpture by Manolo Valdés that guards the entrance.</p><p>Other items in the apartment, including a stool, console table and pedestal table by Claude Lalanne, will be among the star lots at the auction. De Ricqlès said they carry estimates of 120,000 euros to 180,000 euros, or $135,000 to $202,000.</p><p>The auction, to be held on Sept. 13 and 14 to coincide with the Paris Biennale, is expected to net a total of four million euros to six million euros, or $4.5 million to $6.7 million, he added. Christie’s will hold an exhibition featuring dinner tables fully set with Pinto’s wares to whet buyers’ appetites.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/32354959art.jpg><p>“Telling a story, creating an ambience, showing someone’s taste — those are the sales that do well today, and that is what collectors and connoisseurs are looking for,” de Ricqlès said.</p><p>He pointed to the recent success of the sale of 21 pieces by Diego Giacometti, brother of the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, custom-made for the collection of Hubert de Givenchy.</p><p>“It was extraordinary. The estimate was six to eight million euros, and we did 32 million,” he said. “The two biggest lots went to Chinese buyers, which is absolutely revolutionary and new.”</p><p>He estimated that tableware makes up 70 percent of the Pinto sale, and while in theory, potential buyers will be able to bid on small items like salt and pepper shakers — some shaped like owls, others like sirens or shells — the presence of increasingly sophisticated Asian collectors could yield unexpected results.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp5l7pLvMaJ2emaSqv6Z7wqGpoquknrK0ecClmZ6qpKR6sbXNraZmmaWYwaq7zWZoaXBpboJzg44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
