Heres What to Know</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-08-05</div><p>At some point in your fitness journey, you will likely experience either a planned or unintentional break from your exercise routine. Even the most dedicated athletes can find themselves in a situation where they must take a break from their regular workouts. It is unrealistic and often unhealthy to be at “peak fitness” every day, as this requires stressing our bodies beyond what is necessary or healthy.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, many professional athletes have an “off-season” where they take intentional time off from their workouts and let their bodies recover from the stress of high-level training and competition. However, most of us are not professional athletes, and time away from our fitness routines is often due to illness, injury, work commitments, or simply life getting in the way. In these circumstances, many people wonder how long it takes to regain their fitness after inactivity.&nbsp;</p><p>The answer depends on several factors, including your previous fitness level, the duration of your break, and the effort you're willing to invest to regain your fitness. In this article, we want to emphasize that it's vital not to put excessive pressure on ourselves to bounce back immediately. Instead, let's explore how to rediscover wellness at your own pace, recognizing that the path to fitness is a personal journey with no one-size-fits-all timeline.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>{{mid-cta}}</strong></p><h2><strong>First of Things First: What Does It Mean to Be Fit?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Being “fit” has a different definition for everyone. For some, it means having a chiseled physique or being able to run long distances. For others, it means being able to easily perform daily tasks while engaging in the physical activities you enjoy. More generally, “being fit” refers to a state of physical health and well-being that supports physical activity outside of daily movement while reducing the chances of chronic disease.1&nbsp;</p><p>Fitness encompasses various aspects of our overall health, including cardiovascular fitness, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, body composition, and mental and emotional well-being. While there are general guidelines for fitness (i.e., running a mile, doing a push-up, etc.), what it means to be fit ultimately depends on your fitness goals and aspirations, making it a highly individualized journey.</p><h2><strong>What Does It Mean to Lose Fitness?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>When we talk about losing fitness, we're referring to reversing the positive physiological adaptations that occur in response to regular exercise.&nbsp; Muscles may atrophy, cardiovascular endurance decreases, and strength declines. The rate and extent of these changes vary among individuals and depend on factors like genetics, age, general health, and the length of the break away from exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>Some research studies find a loss in cardiovascular fitness (i.e., VO2 max) can happen within two to four weeks of reduced training and loss of muscular strength within four to eight weeks of detraining.1,2,8 Understanding this process requires a closer look at the intricate ways in which exercise benefits the human body as a whole. Both <a href=#>aerobic and anaerobic training</a> in the form of cardio and strength exercises provide a variety of adaptations to our fitness, well-being, and mental health.</p><ul><li>Cardiovascular Endurance: Regular aerobic exercise, like running or cycling, improves cardiovascular fitness and the function of our heart and lungs. During exercise, the heart pumps more blood, which means it needs to beat less often to supply oxygen to the body. Over time, this reduces resting heart rate and lowers blood pressure, enhancing overall heart health. Losing fitness in this context means a reversal of these adaptations, potentially leading to higher resting heart rates, increased blood pressure, and reduced activity tolerance to longer-duration activities.</li><li>Muscular Strength: Strength training builds muscle mass and increases the ability to exert force. When you stop strength training, muscle fibers can atrophy, decreasing strength and endurance. This can result in a reduced ability to perform everyday tasks and an increased risk of injury.</li><li>Flexibility and Mobility: Flexibility is closely linked to the range of motion in your joints. Regular stretching exercises can enhance this movement in your joints and maintain a healthy length of your muscle tissue. When you lose fitness in terms of flexibility, your joints and muscles may become less supple, making movement less comfortable and potentially leading to stiffness and discomfort.</li><li>Power: Muscular power is the ability of your muscles to generate force quickly, which is crucial for activities requiring explosive movements, such as jumping, sprinting, or lifting heavy objects. As we age, muscular power also becomes very important for tasks like getting up from the couch or the floor. When you stop exercising, particularly if you neglect resistance or strength training, the muscles lose the neuromuscular adaptations contributing to power production. This decline in muscular power can cause reduced athletic performance and everyday functionality.&nbsp;</li><li>Metabolism and Weight Management: Exercise is crucial in regulating metabolism and managing body weight. Muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue. When you lose muscle mass due to inactivity, your metabolism may slow down, making it easier to gain weight or <a href=#>harder to </a>achieve weight loss.4</li><li>Bone Health: Weight-bearing exercises like walking, running, and resistance training stimulate bone growth and bone density. Losing fitness in this context can decrease bone density, increasing the risk of osteoporosis.</li></ul><p>Losing fitness is not just a subjective feeling but a physiological process characterized by reversing the positive adaptations that exercise imparts on our bodies. Luckily, the process of losing fitness is 100% reversible. You can get back in shape quickly with a structured workout routine and consistency. The amount of time that takes you to regain fitness depends on various factors, including your initial fitness level, the duration of inactivity, and <a href=#>the intensity</a> of your exercise program.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets-global.website-files.com/63ed08484c069d0492f5b0bc/654152ac566839779cc3b184_guy-doing-exercise-on-floor.jpeg><h2><strong>So, How Long Does It Take to Get Fit Again, and How Can You Do It?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The time needed to make a successful comeback after losing fitness can vary widely for everyone, and it is essential to remember that individual circumstances and goals play a significant role. Most research shows two of the biggest variables affecting the rate and amount of fitness loss include the length of time you spend away from structured training and your fitness level before stopping exercise.2,3&nbsp;</p><p>Generally, it takes anywhere from two to 12 weeks to regain cardiovascular endurance and muscle strength and feel like you’re back at your previous level of fitness.3,5 Regardless of why you took a break from training, let's focus on how you can start regaining your fitness today, keeping in mind that it will take some time to feel strong and fit again.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>How Long Does It Take to Rebuild Muscle and Get Strength Back?</strong></h3><p>Building significant muscle mass and strength gradually requires patience, dedication, and a well-structured workout plan. Additionally, factors such as nutrition, sleep, and <a href=#>recovery</a> play crucial roles in the rate of muscle rebuilding. With a return to consistent <a href=#>weight training</a> two to three days a week, you can expect to see modest improvements in strength within the first three to four weeks due to neuromuscular adaptations.&nbsp;</p><p>More substantial progress in muscle mass and tone can be achieved within two to three months if you follow a progressive training plan. Reaching and potentially surpassing your previous levels of strength often takes several months, typically around three to six months or even longer. Working with a fitness professional or certified personal trainer can help you tailor your program for optimal results, ensuring a safe and effective comeback.</p><h3><strong>How Long Does It Take to Regain Mobility and Flexibility?</strong></h3><p>Regaining mobility and flexibility after weeks of inactivity varies from person to person. In the initial two to three weeks of consistent stretching and mobility exercises, you can expect to experience some improvements in range of motion and reduced stiffness.&nbsp;</p><p>After four to six weeks, more significant gains can be achieved, and you should start to feel noticeably more flexible.6 It may take several months of dedicated stretching and mobility work to fully regain and enhance your flexibility, especially if you were quite flexible before your break.7 Consistency is key in this process, and it's important not to rush or push your body too hard, as that can lead to injuries. Gradual, gentle, and consistent stretching efforts, combined with proper warm-up and cool-down routines, can help you regain and improve your flexibility.</p><h3><strong>How Long Does It Take to Get Your Cardio Endurance On Point Again?</strong></h3><p>The time required to regain cardiovascular endurance (i.e., VO2 max) may be shorter than regaining muscle strength or flexibility despite losing it at a faster rate.8 In the initial three to four weeks of returning to regular aerobic fitness workouts, you can expect significant improvements in your cardiovascular fitness as your heart is asked to pump more blood, increasing your stroke volume and cardiac output.9,10&nbsp;</p><p>To fully regain and potentially surpass your previous levels, it may take several months of regular training, typically around three to four months.10 The rate of improvement can vary based on factors like your initial fitness level and the intensity of your workouts. It's important to start gradually, increase the intensity over time, and maintain consistency to rebuild your cardiovascular endurance effectively. Remember, the key is steady progress rather than rushing the process, as overexertion or pushing too hard can lead to setbacks or injuries.</p><h2><strong>11 Tips to Get Back Into Fitness&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Getting back in shape</a> after a period of time can be a rewarding and empowering journey. Here are some tips to help you make a successful comeback:</p><li><strong>Take it slow and steady</strong>. Don't start too hard.
