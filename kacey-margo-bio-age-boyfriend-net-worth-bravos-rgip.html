Be it navigating dating woes or job obstacles or even culture shock, the audience was in for a ride as if they were the ex-pats themselves.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for Kacey, it was the “help” she never received from the locals. Although she believed the city was the perfect next chapter to take chances, all she received from the French people was “empathy.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“People come to the bar and you will be like, ‘I don’t have any money. I’m really struggling’ and they’ll be like, ‘you can have coffee, you can have water, we have (a) sandwich for you,’” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Initially, Kacey traveled to Paris while taking time off for a semester in college. Bitten by the Parisian bug, she then secured a temporary role as an English teacher in a French classroom. But sadly, she was having some issues with her visa and some instability in her work — threatening her dreams of living abroad.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Joining Kacey for the inaugural season of </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Real</span></i> <i><span style=font-weight:400>Girlfriends in Paris</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> were co-stars — Anya Firestone, Emily Gorelik, Margaux Lignel, Adja Toure, and Victoria Zito.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo Age</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo was 26 years of age when she appeared on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Real</span></i> <i><span style=font-weight:400>Girlfriends in Paris</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> in 2022.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She was one of the younger cast that season.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Kacey Margo Parents?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo was born to her parents, Alan Wilson, and an anonymous mother.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her father, Alan is a Houston, Texas native who attended </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Lamar High School, Harvard Business School</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, and later studied Civil engineering at the </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> (MIT).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her siblings, Kacey has an older brother named </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Austin Wilson</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (who turned 30 on February 8, 2022) and a sister named </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Sloane Wilson</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> (who is a </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Stanford University</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> graduate).</span></p><p><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Here</span></a><span style=font-weight:400>’s her family photo.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><strong>Trivia:</strong> Kacey’s paternal grandmother Mary Ann Lancaster Wilson passed away n December 31, 2018, following a brief illness, at the age of 92.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo Height</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo stands tall at a height above 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm).</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mentioning her distinct features, Kacey has dark eyes and hair, a triangular face, and a fit body.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo Job</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo is an English teacher at a Teaching Assistant Program in France.

So, this was probably what Kacey earned as well.</span></p><h3><b>Kacey Margo Boyfriend</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kacey Margo didn’t have a boyfriend in 2022. She celebrated her Valentine that year with a human-sized teddy bear.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“💓🧸🍫! #bearly found a #valentine in time this year!!! also: #chocolate can fix anything your therapist can’t,” she posted an IG pic with the lucky bear on Feb 16.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As for her ex-boyfriend, he dumped her right after she moved to Paris. “The guy I was with was like, ‘I don’t do long distance’ and I was like, ‘that’s so weird because you’re in Pittsburgh and I’m in LA,’” she explained.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thereafter, Kacey was “super over dating in general and being in a relationship.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But as much as Kacey hates him now, she still hasn’t deleted tweets related to him (at the time of writing this article).
