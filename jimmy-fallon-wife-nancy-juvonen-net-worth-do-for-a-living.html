You’ll never read this because you’re not on social media, but as we all know these posts will be here forever so I’m sure the kids will see this one day and say 'Gosh, dad was a romantic.'"</p><p>And while many <a href=#>celebrities have crushes on Jimmy Fallon</a>, Nancy Juvonen definitely has his heart.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nancy-juvonen-jimmy-fallon-2.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nancy Juvonen has a $20 million net worth</a>, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

While she has a $20 million net worth, Celebrity Net Worth puts his at $60 million. This makes sense considering the high salary that he is continually paid for his job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A08FBC61-9022-4DF7-AFDB-1842D24B2AA1.jpeg><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Jimmy Fallon is paid $16 million each year to host The Tonight Show.</p><p>Fallon has been hosting his show since 2014, and since there have been 10 seasons so far, that has definitely given him the opportunity to accumulate a lot of wealth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon Was Holding Back Tears After Taylor Swift Surprised Him With One Of The Most Emotional Moments On The Tonight Show</a></span></p><p>Fallon has also done some acting, which has made him money as well. Besides starring in Fever Pitch, he played Dennis Hope in Almost Famous and starred in movies ranging from Whip It to Factory Girl and Arthur and the Invisibles. He has also played a version of himself in several movies, such as Jurassic World and Ted 2.</p><h2 id=what-is-nancy-juvonen-39-s-job-like>What Is Nancy Juvonen's Job Like?</h2><p>Flower Films have produced many romantic comedies starring Drew Barrymore, which of course makes sense. That includes Fever Pitch, 50 First Dates, Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, and Never Been Kissed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nancy-juvonen-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Flower Films has also produced He's Just Not That Into You, Donnie Darko, the 2019 remake of Charlie's Angels, and How To Be Single. Most recently, the company worked on The Stand In, a movie that was released in 2020.</p><p>Nancy Juvonen works in TV as well, as Flower Films produced The Santa Clarita Diet, the <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a> series starring Barrymore as a woman who turns into a zombie. Flower Films is also behind The Drew Barrymore Show, the talk show that has been on the air since 2020. While the company definitely focuses on movies, they have also produced Princess Power, Knife Fight and Tough Love Couples.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Drew Barrymore Know How To Sing?

She has no social media accounts, which her husband has mentioned on his own Instagram, and she doesn't seem to give many interviews. However, she is always all smiles when shown on her husband Jimmy Fallon's social media. Drew Barrymore, in contrast, has spoken a lot about Flower Films, which makes sense since she's a public figure.</p><p>In an interview with Marie Claire, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barrymore talked about Flower Films</a> and praised Juvonen.</p><p>She spoke about working with her and said, "There were so many women before me who helped pave the way for me to be a female producer. I don’t think that me and my partner, Nancy Fallon, went into it thinking, 'as females we’re going to take this opportunity and kill it'. We went in as hardworking producers and we killed ourselves to earn a seat at the table, and to earn the trust of the studios."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/nancy-juvonen-jimmy-fallon-kids.jpg><p>Barrymore shared that they worked with a female studio head behind Charlie's Angels which made things easier.</p><p>She continued to Marie Claire, "we never felt like we were fighting to be in this boys’ club. But it felt good that we were these two women working together and making some great products that made the studios really happy."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/drew-barrymore.jpg><p>It sounds like Juvonen and Barrymore have enjoyed a great working relationship for the last few decades.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jimmy Fallon praises for his wife Nancy Juvonen as well. In 2014, after becoming a father, Fallon said during an episode of The Tonight Show, "The truest thing I can say is... sometimes you just know. But that’s terrible advice. The only people who say that are the people who just knew. How do you know unless you found that person? I think you just look for the person you have the most fun with. And that’s enough."</p><p>Fallon added during the episode, "You realize, “Wait, I can just keep having fun with her forever?” Yes, you can do that. It’s the secret."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihoqWdrnqnrculpqdlp56zpnnNmqWcsV2fwre7zZ6lZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2acn2KzsL6MmmSloaaeu6h7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
