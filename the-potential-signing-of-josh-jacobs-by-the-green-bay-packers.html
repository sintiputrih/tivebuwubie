While the terms of the deal have not been officially disclosed, NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero have reported that the Packers are expected to secure Jacobs, according to sources familiar with the situation.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Potential Benefits for the Green Bay Packers</h2><h3 data-mce-fragment=1>Offensive Powerhouse</h3><p data-mce-fragment=1>The potential signing of Josh Jacobs presents an exciting prospect for the Green Bay Packers' offense. Jacobs' exceptional abilities as a running back, showcased by his impressive 2022 season, offer the Packers a formidable rushing threat.
