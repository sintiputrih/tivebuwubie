Recommended Videos The Alexandrians turned Commonwealth exiles found themselves in quite a spot of bother in the latest episode of The Walking Dead, with a large number of our favorites ending up in a labor camp governed by a Warden who is evidently not to be crossed, while the scrappier of our band of heroes managed to make an escape and even pull off a rescue mission."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Where is that, exactly? We have a few thoughts.</p><h2 id=h-the-civic-republic data-injectable=false><strong>The Civic Republic</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/the-crm-walking-dead-world-beyond.png><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=296 data-injectable=false>The Civic Republic, home base to the Civic Republic Military (CRM) was likely Connie’s destination before she was rescued. While the crew of characters in The Walking Dead series hasn’t had to deal with this mob just yet, all signs seem to point to them butting heads before the series wraps.</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>The CRM is a force even more powerful than The Commonwealth, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fear the Walking Dead</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Walking Dead: World Beyond</a> has dealt with this mob in varying capacities. On the latter show, it was revealed that the helicopter in which Rick Grimes made his exit from The Walking Dead belongs to the CRM since Jadis traded Rick for entry into the settlement.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=264 data-current-count=264 data-injectable=false>The CRM stays out of the way of groups like The Commonwealth and Jadis’ scavengers, as long as those settlements regularly provide the CRM with new people – either to join the ranks of its military or to be used as test subjects for its reanimation research.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true>Considering Hornsby’s pleas for his life to Pamela Milton earlier in the season, saying some relationships with third parties would become strained if he was stripped of his power and/or life, it’s a pretty safe bet that Connies ‘designation 2’ label meant that she was bound for the CRM.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>What the label actually meant for her fate within the colony, is anyone’s guess. But knowing Milton, we don’t think the red carpet was about to be rolled out for the journalist that put her under the microscope.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZmytLXGp5itoZ%2BjenN5yKdkraCVYsSiuMqipaBllJqupXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
