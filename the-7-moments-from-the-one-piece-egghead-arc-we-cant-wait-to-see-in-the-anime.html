Recommended Videos After four years in Wano, everyone is ready to continue the journey of a lifetime. Thankfully, the time is nigh, and the One Piece anime is finally set to explore Egghead Island.
Fans who have been reading the manga are already well-acquainted with the island. Egghead was introduced in chapter 1061, marking the beginning of the Final Saga of One Piece."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Thankfully, the time is nigh, and the <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Piece</a></strong> anime is finally set to explore Egghead Island.</p><p data-characters=337 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true>Fans who have been reading the manga are already well-acquainted with the island. Egghead was introduced in chapter 1061, marking the beginning of the Final Saga of One Piece. Aptly named, this portion of the story is incredibly convoluted with information, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">finally introducing what were the series’ biggest mysteries until today</a>.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>As anime-only watchers, you’ve likely seen the Egghead poster teasing the upcoming arc. However, don’t be fooled by its colorful spread and fun attires – this arc is anything but. Here are all the major moments in the new arc that you don’t want to miss out on.</p><h2 id=h-vegapunk-s-introduction data-injectable=false>Vegapunk’s Introduction</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/vegapunk-one-piece-manga.jpg><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>Unsurprisingly, as the Straw Hats reach Egghead – the island where Vegapunk is stationed – <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">we finally encounter the infamous government scientist and all seven of his bodies</a>. Alongside his physical form, we delve into his upbringing and general history, uncovering his past connections with Monkey D. Dragon, Bartholomew Kuma, and, of course, bits and pieces of his involvement with the MADS. Ultimately, much of the lore we know today is a result of Vegapunk’s introduction at Egghead.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jewelry Bonney’s return</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Bonney-Kuma-One-Piece-manga.jpg><p data-characters=448 data-current-count=748 data-injectable=true>The last time we saw Bonney was during the Levely arc, where she posed as Conney from the Sorbet Kingdom. Therefore, her reappearance in the Egghead arc was incredibly surprising. As a fan-favorite character, we’ve seen very little of Bonney, but her presence in this arc promises to unravel many mysteries, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">including her birth as the child of a Celestial Dragon and Ginny</a>, as well as her connection to Kuma, whom she refers to as her father.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Garp fighting the Blackbeard Pirates</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Garp-manga.jpg><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=true>One of the many adjacent stories happening in the Egghead arc is Koby’s rescue. As his mentor, Garp went above and beyond to save his fellow Marine by heading to Hachinosu – the location where the Blackbeard Pirates had taken Koby. The Admiral enlisted the members of Sword, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and even Tashigi</a>, for the rescue mission, resulting in the decimation of part of the island with his power, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">along with some Blackbeard pirates</a>. He eventually fought with his former protégé – Kuzan – and the outcome of their fight is still unknown.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Imu and the true form of Saturn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Jaygarcia-Saturn.jpg><p data-characters=519 data-current-count=819 data-injectable=true>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Elders have long been mysteries in One Piece</a>. While we knew of their existence and had some insight into their role in the story, their essence remained shrouded in mystery. To everyone’s surprise, the Egghead arc <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not only reintroduces Imu</a>, but also introduces Jaygarcia Saturn – The Warrior God of Science and Defense. Unexpectedly, he becomes a major antagonist in the arc, and we’ve recently witnessed his true form in the story, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">along with his evident shock while facing Luffy in Gear 5 mode</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Luffy fighting Kizaru</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/One-Piece-Manga-Luffy-Borsalino.jpg><p data-characters=520 data-current-count=820 data-injectable=true>We had all been craving to see Luffy in Gear 5 once more, and Egghead will provide just that. Apart from witnessing Luffy in all his white-haired glory, Kizaru also re-enters the narrative. The Marine admiral steps into the Egghead arc with the mission to retrieve Vegapunk and, ultimately, to force the Straw Hats out of the advanced island. Though things don’t necessarily go according to plan, their clash is a sight to behold, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">showcasing two of the strongest Devil Fruits in the story</a> going against each other.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Rock’s Pirates’ first appearance as a group</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/one-piece-rocks-pirates.jpg><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=810 data-injectable=true>Egghead is an arc overflowing with flashbacks and lore. Among the numerous story moments that fans might occasionally overlook are the Rocks Pirates – the infamous and ruthless pirate group that Garp and Gol D. Roger defeated back in God Valley. The so-called “God Valley Incident,” previously mentioned in Wano during a flashback, takes center stage in Egghead. Here, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the members of the Rocks Pirates are finally unveiled</a>, shedding light on the reasons behind the God Valley incident altogether.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Kuma’s story</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kuma-Vegapunk-One-Piece-manga.jpg><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>Perhaps the most iconic moment we can’t wait to see in the anime is Kuma’s backstory. Not only do we witness his daughter Bonney accessing his memory bubbles, but throughout the flashbacks, we delve into his history <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as a Buccaneer slave alongside Ivankov and Ginny</a>. We learn about his past as a slave and priest, the events that led him to become the King of Sorbet Kingdom, and how he transitioned <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">from being a rebel in the revolutionary army to becoming a human weapon for the World Government.</a></p><p data-characters=75 data-current-count=75 data-injectable=false>The One Piece Egghead arc will finally begin on Crunchyroll, on January 7.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6tn55lZ2K6sLnEp6usZZanvK5506GcZqeemnqxtcScnGadl5y1pq3DZpirm12ssm6vwKerZq%2BRnsFuwM5mqp6dXZ67bsDHnmSappmisnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
