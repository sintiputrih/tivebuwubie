As modern pagans, we often celebrate them under one big harvest umbrella. Some people lean more into one than another. Wiccans may prefer Lammas, Irish Celts Lughnasadh, and the Norse are fans of Freyfaxi.</p><p><strong>These holidays have much in common. They all:</strong></p><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Festivals to celebrate the harvest of grains</p></li><li><p>The first grain was cut and baked to honor the gods</p></li><li><p>Have its origins in agricultural pagan worship which honored the earth and her fertility</p></li></ul><p>Their origins go back to ancient cultures in Western Europe</p><p>Celebrate one or all three in a way that suits your quest and pagan path.

In the early days of Wiccan history, it was referred to as August Eve. While its roots delve into ancient pagan traditions, the modern version of Lamas is more of a Wiccan and Neopagan holiday.</p><p>Lamas is the first of the Wiccan harvest celebrations in the Wheel of the Year and occurs in early August (early February down under) which is the midpoint between summer and fall. You may also hear it called a cross-quarter day - halfway between the summer and autumn equinox.</p><p>The holiday is commemorated by baking a loaf of bread in the shape of a god.</p><p>August was a month for feasting, celebrating the harvest, and <a href=#>handfastings</a>.</p><p>Christians regard this as a Christian holiday and refer to it as “loaf day”. This holiday of course originated from the pagan celebration and was an attempt to convert the heathens.</p><h2><strong>Lammas Correspondences:</strong></h2><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p><strong>Symbolic Meaning</strong>: Abundance, harvest, prosperity, transformation</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Planet</strong>: Sun</p></li><li><p><strong>Ruling Element</strong>: Fire</p></li><li><p><strong>Season</strong>: Summer</p></li><li><p><strong>Corresponding Star Sign</strong>: Leo</p></li><li><p><strong>Plants: </strong>Barley, corn, sunflowers, squash blossoms</p></li><li><p><strong>Herbs/Scents: </strong>Basil, calendula, frankincense, marigold, poppy, rosemary, rose, sandalwood</p></li><li><p><strong>Animals/Mythological Creatures:</strong> Bees, <a href=#>Cow/Ox,</a> Centaurs, Griffins, <a href=#>Horses</a>, Pigs, Phoenix, Rooster, Salmon</p></li><li><p><strong>Birds: </strong>Raven, Chickens</p></li><li><p><strong>Colors: </strong>Brown, green orange, yellow</p></li><li><p><strong>Gemstone</strong>: Adventurine, carnelian, obsidian, tiger’s eye.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tools:</strong> bonfires, corn dollies, garden tools, spear, scythe,</p></li><li><p><strong>Deities:</strong> Ceres, Cerridwen, Isis, Lugh</p></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f9dc5a6b2c3096899c6af79/e255377a-dbf3-494e-b909-9ac29f26199f/My+Boy+Rocket.png><h2><strong>Who Is Lugh?</strong></h2><p>The Celts celebrated the god Lugh with the festival of Lughnasadh. Lugh, sometimes called Lug, is the God of light and sun.</p><p>Lugh is celebrated during August along with his mother Tailtiu, Goddess of Earth. Together they represent the abundance of the harvest, strength, and endurance.</p><h3><strong>Who is John Barleycorn?</strong></h3><p>Many of us who are Americans may be unfamiliar with John Barleycorn, a traditional Scottish folk song about a man named John Barleycorn. A famous poem was written about him by <a href=#>Robert Burns</a> in 1782.</p><p>The song describes him as a representation of barley and the resulting beer describes his suffering, death, and resurrection. This metaphor demonstrates the spirit of the healthy grain in summer, which is then chopped down and “killed”, only to be resurrected again in the beer.</p><p>Written versions of the song are quite old, dating back to 1568, but Barleycorn represents a more modern version of the God Beowa. Beowa is the Celtic god of barley and agriculture.</p><p>Many neo-pagans today look upon Lugh as representing John Barleycorn as the living spirit of the grain.</p><h2>Lammas Magick</h2><ul data-rte-list=default><li><p>Appreciating what our Earth does for our lives</p></li><li><p>Reinforcing long-term spellwork</p></li><li><p>Visualize yourself completing a project you’ve started</p></li><li><p>astrology, prosperity, generosity, continued success, good fortune, abundance, magickal picnic, meditate &</p></li><li><p>Sweeping is a natural gathering motion.
