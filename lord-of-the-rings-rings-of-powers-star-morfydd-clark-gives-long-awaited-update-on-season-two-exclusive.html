Speaking about when to expect the show, head of Amazon Studios Jenny Salke told Variety: “We want the shortest time possible between seasons, but we want to keep the bar just as high. So it'll take what it takes but there's been some urgency around moving quickly, which is why these guys have been writing all through their hiatus.”</p><p id=eq9ub-QtSg75 data-wc=60>Amazon Studios’ head of television Vernon Sanders also shut down any hope that it would air in 2023, saying: “It would be amazing if we could get season two out within a year of season one's release. It may take a smidge longer than that, but we're doing everything we can, and we'll get better and faster as we go.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/14eeedc25260-rpazs1ut210709gramat00445r3.jpg><p id=eUOF43HotiYa data-wc=35>Season one certainly left fans wanting more after it was revealed that Halbrand was actually Sauron, while it is also confirmed that ‘the Stranger’ is the wizard Istari (who may or may not be Gandalf).&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power recasts major role for season 2 following criticism&nbsp;" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0bfce811c67d-joseph-rawle-empire-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power recasts major role for season 2 following criticism&nbsp;" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power recasts major role for season 2 following criticism&nbsp;</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power: meet the cast" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/d50b4e13aace-lotr-ring-power-t.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power: meet the cast" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power: meet the cast</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e1TgTHHQsWGV data-wc=51>Speaking about the major revelation about Halbrand, Charlie Vicker revealed that he didn’t initially know about his character’s hidden identity.

With a couple of months to go, the showrunners told me.&nbsp;</p><p id=egx4UQD4rc5N data-wc=51>“Prior to that I had some suspicions. I auditioned with a couple of monologues, one as Richard III and the other as Satan in Paradise Lost, so I had a feeling that there was going to be a dark twist to the character, and I was suspicious of it being Sauron.”</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
