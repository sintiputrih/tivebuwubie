Sum 41 Lyrics
Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Stormin' through the party like my name was El Niño
When I'm hangin' out drinkin' in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody cameWell, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The song begins with the party scene, where the singer, referred to as El Niño, enters and creates a chaotic environment. The next lines describe how the singer never used to be popular and often went unnoticed, but now, he has everything he wants, but he still feels caged. The singer expresses frustration about society's expectations of him and his peers and how he doesn't want to follow their conventions. The chorus reflects the singer's determination to not be a part of society's conformities and not waste his time becoming another casualty.</p><br><p>The second verse talks about how the singer and his friends are often misunderstood and judged by society. They like to have fun at other people's expense and don't care about "act[ing] their age." The third verse is more confrontational, where the singer raps about his dislike for hypocritical people who put down others who are different from them. The last line of the verse reflects on the singer’s recklessness and how others *count on him* never to be "listenin'."<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Stormin' through the party like my name was El Niño</u><br>I am making a grand entrance into the party like a storm named El Niño.</p><br><p><u>When I'm hangin' out drinkin' in the back of an El Camino</u><br>I'm drinking and hanging out in the back of a Chevrolet El Camino.</p><br><p><u>As a kid, I was a skid, and no one knew me by name</u><br>When I was young, I was a troublemaker, and nobody bothered to remember my name.</p><br><p><u>Trashed my own house party 'cause nobody came</u><br>I destroyed my own party at home because no one showed up and I was disappointed.</p><br><p><u>Well, I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school</u><br>I am not the person you remember from high school, and I am aware of that.</p><br><p><u>Never goin', never showin' up when we had to</u><br>I hate going to places where I have to show up, and I often don't.</p><br><p><u>Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave</u><br>We crave attention and don't like being told to behave.</p><br><p><u>I'm sick of always hearin', "Act your age"</u><br>I am tired of always being told to act my age.</p><br><p><u>Because you don't know us at all, we laugh when old people fall</u><br>You don't really know us, so we laugh about anything, such as old people who fall down.</p><br><p><u>But what would you expect with a conscience so small?</u><br>We have such small consciences, so what else would you expect from us?</p><br><p><u>Heavy metal and mullets, it's how we were raised</u><br>We were raised with heavy metal music and mullet hairstyles.</p><br><p><u>Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised</u><br>Iron Maiden and Judas Priest were the bands we admired and worshipped.</p><br><p><u>'Cause we like havin' fun at other people's expense, and</u><br>We enjoy having fun by making fun of other people.</p><br><p><u>Cuttin' people down is just a minor offense, then</u><br>We don't think that cutting other people down is a significant wrongdoing.</p><br><p><u>It's none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn</u><br>It's none of your business, and I don't think I'll ever understand what I'm doing wrong.</p><br><p><u>I'm sick of being told to wait my turn</u><br>I am weary of being told to wait for my turn.</p><br><p><u>Don't count on me to let you know when</u><br>Please don't rely on me to inform you.</p><br><p><u>I'll do it again</u><br>I will repeat what I did before.</p><br><p><u>It's the point you're missin'</u><br>You are missing the point.</p><br><p><u>'Cause I'm not listenin'</u><br>I'm not listening.</p><br><p><u>Well, I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat</u><br>I'm a lower middle class troublemaker.</p><br><p><u>Backpack and I don't give a shit about nothin'</u><br>I carry a backpack and don't care about anything.</p><br><p><u>You be standin' on the corner talkin' all that kufuffin</u><br>You are hanging out on the street corner and talking nonsense.</p><br><p><u>But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffin'</u><br>You don't make sense because you're high on gasoline fumes.</p><br><p><u>'Cause if the egg don't stain, you'll be ringin' off the hook</u><br>If a prank call doesn't shock you, you'll be bothered about it all day.</p><br><p><u>You're on the hit list, wanted in the telephone book</u><br>You are on the hit list and wanted by the authorities as per the telephone book.</p><br><p><u>I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion</u><br>I enjoy listening to loud music and drinking in moderation.</p><br><p><u>The doctor said my mom should've had an abortion</u><br>The doctor told my mom that she should have aborted me.</p><br><p><u>Casualty of society</u><br>I don't want to become a victim of society's expectations.</p><br><p><u>Victim of your conformity and back down</u><br>I don't want to become a victim of your pressure to conform.</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.<br>Written by: Deryck Whibley, Greig Nori, Steve Jocz, Dave Baksh</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIuloqx1fY5%2FmK2XfJ69</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
