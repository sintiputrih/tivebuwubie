Hayes proposed that Waller should face Trick since he didn’t have a match scheduled for the night. Waller initially declined, citing his status on Smackdown and his preference for facing top-tier opponents.</p><p>However, Hayes remained steadfast in his confidence that Trick would emerge victorious, going so far as to put Trick’s number one contender spot on the line to prove it. Waller ultimately accepted the challenge, setting the stage for an intriguing showdown.</p><p>The broadcast then went to a commercial break.</p><p>Riley Osborne passionately declared that tonight’s match was the most significant of his life.

Baron advised Bron to drop the tough guy persona and proposed the idea of forming a tag team for the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic. Although Baron admitted it went against his instincts, he believed they could make a formidable team.</p><p>Bron couldn’t help but chuckle at the notion of Baron seeking him out as a partner. Baron argued that they were both “a-holes” and that their combined strength could dominate the tournament and lead them to the tag team titles. Bron playfully suggested he could lead the team with “baldy” (referring to Baron) following behind him.</p><p>Baron, on the other hand, declared that he would be the one doing the destruction while Bron focused on his tanning. Ultimately, Bron seemed to warm up to the idea, and they appeared to be on the same page about teaming up.</p><p>The show then transitioned to an Oba Femi video package, where he emphasized his Nigerian heritage and the culture of strength that he came from. He expressed his determination to win the contract and become the “giant” of NXT.</p><p>Following the video package, there was a backstage encounter between Gigi Dolin and Cora Jade.

Ridge emphasized that he was a father and a friend, not someone looking to end careers. He expressed his desire for redemption and to prove himself to the NXT Universe, vowing to go through the roster to do so. Ridge was determined to show who he truly was during his return to NXT.</p><p>During a segment, Thea Hail was pushed into Riley Osborne by Jacy Jayne, who announced that she would be ringside to watch Riley’s match. They exchanged a high-five, and Thea was overwhelmed with excitement, declaring that she would never wash her hand again after this memorable moment.

Riley attempted to break free by striking Oba with forearms, but Oba responded with a knee and an Irish whip into the ropes. Oba returned to the bear hug, squeezing the air out of Riley.</p><p>Riley continued to battle, using forearms to escape the bear hug. However, Oba countered with a uranage backbreaker, inflicting more damage on Riley’s spine. Oba once again resorted to the bear hug, maintaining control of the match. Riley managed to break free from Oba’s hold with a jawbreaker.</p><p>Oba struck Riley with a forearm to the back and a European uppercut before attempting another Irish whip. However, Riley avoided the shoulder in the corner, causing Oba to collide with the ring post. Seizing the opportunity, Riley delivered a chop and attempted a crucifix and a sunset flip, but Oba countered by picking up Riley. Riley shifted his strategy and executed a headscissors takedown followed by a dropkick. He continued with a twisting moonsault for a near fall and a running uppercut.</p><p>Riley then ascended the turnbuckle and executed a shooting star press, but Oba got his knees up, inflicting damage on Riley in the process.

Lucien emphasized their family connection and their shared roots, describing how they were connected from the bottom. Bronco continued, saying that he saw no hunger in Tony’s eyes, whereas they were hungry for success. He highlighted the gold they had around their mouths, necks, and ears, but they needed gold around their waists.

They claimed to have conquered the streets and the system and were determined to become the new tag team champions.</p><p>Kelly then interviewed Izzi Dame and Kiana James. Izzi explained that she chose to join forces with Kiana after slamming the door on Roxanne and realizing she made the right decision.

She saw dollar signs in their future and believed that with her guidance, everyone would soon know who Izzi Dame is.</p><p>In the locker room, Hayes and Trick discussed Melo’s decision to put up his title match. Hayes expressed confidence in Trick’s abilities and assured him that he had everything under control.

Hayes affirmed his confidence in Trick’s abilities.</p><p>The show then went to a commercial break.</p><p>In a backstage segment, Thea and Jacy discussed Riley Osborne’s recent performance and his potential sadness. Thea suggested getting him a gift card to console him. Duke and Andre then joined the conversation, emphasizing the importance of the Dusty Cup.

Thea expressed excitement about this potential partnership, and Jacy emphasized her intention to take the necessary steps to secure their future.</p><p>Lyra was seen sitting on a production box when Tatum Paxley approached her. Tatum commented on Lyra still being the champion.</p><p>Axiom and Frazer had a backstage discussion about the Dusty Cup.

They believed that the established tag teams had failed, and it was time for a wake-up call.</p><p>Edris Enofe and Malik Blade then appeared, and Frazer acted as if nothing had happened between them. Edris expressed their eagerness to silence Axiom and Frazer and hoped to be the ones to prove Frazer wrong.</p><p>Channing and Tony were asked about the earlier comments made during the show.
