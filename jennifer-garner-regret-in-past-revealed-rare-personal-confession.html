And if I'm driving for a long time, I will reapply. Especially if I'm driving, I'm not even kidding, I'll reapply for the left side of my body because it's getting so much more sun exposure," she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=e5M-c2Uf2H data-wc=10><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Garner discusses eye-rolling teen daughter in latest interview</a></p><p id=eKvDmhfLOjP data-wc=17><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Jennifer Garner reveals the surprising way her three kids side with dad Ben Affleck over her</a></strong></p><p id=e-uTQBLx-f data-wc=45>The actress has been based in LA for many years - known for its sun all year around.
