That’s equal to around $14 million today after adjusting for inflation. Karen Carpenter was born in New Haven, Connecticut in March 1950 and passed away in February 1983. Technically she only had around $2000 in cash in her bank account at the time of her death. The rest of her fortune was invested in illiquid assets which eventually caused her estate to incur huge tax burdens. More than 60% of her net worth was eaten away by final expenses and taxes. Karen was best known for being one half of the band The Carpenters with her brother Richard Carpenter. The Carpenters released their debut studio album Ticket to Ride in 1969 under the name Offering. Their second album Close to You was released in 1970 and was certified 2x Platinum and reached #1 in Canada and #2 in the United States. The group also had multi-platinum albums with their releases Carpenters in 1971, A Song for You in 1972, and Now & Then in 1973. The Carpenters had #1 singles with the songs “(They Long to Be) Close to You”, “We’ve Only Just Begun”, “For All We Know”, “Rainy Days and Mondays”, “Superstar”, “Hurting Each Other”, “Sing”, “Yesterday Once More”, “Top of the World”, “I Won’t Last a Day Without You”, “Please Mr. Postman”, “Only Yesterday”, “Solitaire”, “There’s a Kind of Hush”, “I Need to Be in Love”, and “Touch Me When We’re Dancing”. Karen Carpenter suffered from an eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. She passed away on February 4, 1983 at 32 years of age from heart failure caused by complications from her illness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKORp7KvecKaqamdnqmys7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jJugqJ%2Bilr2pxYycmKudlad6osPAq5usZZaWsLV5wKebZqSZm7Juv9OoqbJn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
