I’m no good at trivia, but I can always impress my (non-comedy nerd) friends and family members by knowing the names of actors in commercials because so many of them are stand up and improv comics. From a 2009 episode of The Comedy Nerds Podcast called <a href=#>Comedians in Commercials</a> comes this: “It’s a great way to make money and also to get seen. For many comedians, they’re good actors, and have good comedic timing and good comedic abilities and it’s hard to get someone to actually pay for that in the stand up comedy world. The path of least resistance is probably commercials. … For those people who are talented enough to do it, it’s a good way to survive between better paying gigs or no paying gigs. … It also becomes a good vehicle.” And that explains it! Though, in the same podcast episode, commercial acting is jokingly referred to as the “whoring out of talent for commercial purposes.” Fair enough.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uylpb0crnx984q925sx59@published data-word-count=54>But as a comedy fan, because there aren’t many remaining outlets on television showcasing up and coming comedic talent — late night shows, John Oliver’s New York Stand Up Show, and Live At Gotham come to mind, it’s always a nice treat to see a comedian whose work I enjoy pop up on screen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uylpb0crox984yw0rzexz@published data-word-count=7>Let’s look at some examples, shall we?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uylpb0crpx98478yz7tbe@published data-word-count=9><strong>Lauren Ashley Bishop for Midol and <a href=#>Mini Babybel Cheese</a></strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uylpb0crqx984s4z7u8rv@published data-word-count=70>Female stand up comics in commercials for women’s products.

She had just seen me at a show the night before and I booked that job. And then, as a result, I got a commercial agent. But I had been trying trying trying to get a commercial agent up until then and no one was interested. …I got recognized one time by a 12-year-old boy who was obsessed with Stella and he was really psyched to meet me… and maybe one or two times I got recognized for commercials.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uylpb0crxx984lh0ifw7p@published data-word-count=0></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uylpb0cryx984i052ez60@published data-word-count=11><strong>Matt McCarthy for Verizon, Office Max, Guinness, US Cellular, and more</strong></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0uylpb0crzx984f8mkclee@published data-word-count=48>In his <a href=#>stand up</a>, his <a href=#>Front Page Films videos</a> with fellow stand up comic and commercial actor Pete Holmes, and in the commercials below, Matt McCarthy displays a wide range of comedic talents.
