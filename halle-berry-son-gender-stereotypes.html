If we want to have a future that's different, that is where it starts," she said of her son, Maceo Martinez, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/parents/halle-berry-challenges-son-to-rethink-gender-stereotypes/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">People</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She continued, sharing that she has already noticed the way her son's views on gender are being implicitly shaped. "You made me think of how many conversations I've had with him, say, since he's turned five years old, about the differences in boys and girls, and I see how he's taught to feel like he's superior, at five, than girls are," said Berry.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I've had to really break that down for him and give him a new perspective, and challenge those thoughts and ask him to identify where that comes from, and if he believes that or not and challenge what he's subconsciously getting from somewhere," she continued. "I can tell that because we're having those conversations he is going to grow as a deep thinker on the subject. He's going to be determined not to just accept it. I keep challenging him all the time, like 'Well, why is that a 'girl color?'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Berry makes her U.S. directorial debut with Bruised at this year's Sundance Film Festival.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
