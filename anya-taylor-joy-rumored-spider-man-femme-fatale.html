Previously, actress Felicity Jones played the character in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, and Tricia Helfer voiced the character in The Spectacular Spider-Man animated series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Felicia Hardy has feline-based powers which include enhanced strength and agility. She also has a "bad luck aura" that she can use against her enemies. When her powers later mutate, she is granted extraordinary balance and retractable claws.</p><p>The character is known to comic book fans as Spider-Man's friend and enemy both, and the two share a complicated relationship. Black Cat was only attracted to the alter ego of Spider-Man, and is disinterested in the hero's normal life as Peter Parker. When his identity is revealed, she ends up being disgusted of him.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Signs That Andrew Garfield And Tobey Maguire Will Be In 'Spider-Man: No Way Home'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Anya Taylor-Joy has been in the news ever since <a href=#>she appeared in The Witch</a>, but her award-winning performance in <a href=#>Netflix's miniseries, The Queen's Gambit</a>, solidified her role as one of Hollywood's most talented new actresses.</p><p>She has displayed her acting chops in a wide range of projects — from playing an orphan chess prodigy in the Netflix show to the psychological horror film Last Night In Soho, where she played the aspiring singer Sandie.
