He's been pouring his energy into healing his mind and body since then, and over the past few weeks, we've even seen him out and about enjoying some of his <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">favourite activities</a>.

They first got together in 2013 after she ended her marriage to Mission Impossible star Tom Cruise. For the next six years, the pair was on-again-off-again, until 2019, when they ultimately <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">called it quits</a>. In the past, Holmes has said that the "Gold Digger" hitmaker's partying lifestyle is what ended their union. "It has been many years of him stepping out with other women. He’s disrespectful and their lives were different. His partying ways don’t fit with hers as she’s focused on raising her daughter and working," a source told UsWeekly at the time.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jamie-foxx-s-recovery-is-pointing-him-toward-katie-holmes>Jamie Foxx's Recovery is Pointing Him Toward Katie Holmes</h2></span><p>Katie Holmes (L) and Jamie Foxx attend the Clive Davis and Recording Academy Pre-GRAMMY Gala on January 27, 2018, in New York City.

"Jamie has dated scores of beautiful women in his life, but none came close to matching what he had with Katie," one insider dished. "Their chemistry was off the charts. It was a romance born of passion but became so much more. In hindsight, Jamie can't believe he let her slip through his fingers."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">From the sounds of things, Jamie Foxx is laser-focused on bringing his former lover back into his life at this time. Thankfully the <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">backlash</a> he faced after a recent IG Story scandal has died down enough for him to continue manifesting that, along with a full, healthy recovery.
