The Hawaii native hit yet another homerun when she joined the Hallmark family in 2020. In "Holly & Ivy," Parrish's character befriends her terminally ill neighbor and eventually adopts her two daughters. It's a tear-jerker and Parrish was proud to start her Hallmark career with such a complex and unique role. "The message of trauma, sometimes bringing about the most beautiful things if you let it, that message really stuck with me," she told <a href=#>PopSugar</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>Another thing she's incredibly proud of is championing representation. In 2021, she starred in "Right in Front of Me" opposite Marco Grazzini. As Parrish proudly told <a href=#>Access</a>, it was the first time a Hallmark film had two Asian-American leads. "It's really wonderful to be a part of that next step of inclusivity and diversity and representation," she gushed. In 2023, she starred in her first mystery, "Family History Mysteries: Buried Past." While promoting the flick, the actor was asked about <a href=#>Candace Cameron Bure's controversial comments</a> on LGBTQ representation at Great American Family. Parrish responded to&nbsp;<a href=#>Access</a>, "I am thrilled, thrilled, thrilled to be working with Hallmark, and I think that the stories that they're making are so beautiful, and inclusive, and diverse." She later enthused, "Representation matters."</p><p dir=ltr>She's continuing to work outside Hallmark, too. In December 2022, <a href=#>Deadline</a> learned Parrish would produce and star in "Sydney vs. Sean," a drama written by her co-star Ryan Powers<strong>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmampkaoV4hY6up2aZnpl6pLvMoqWgZZiWua25wKuiZpmTqbyzv4yamaitpGLBsHnSnpxmnaaav7rDx56pnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
