The two eventually parted ways in 2022. Despite having a <a href=#>joint net worth of over $700 million</a> before divorcing, the separation appeared relatively simple. It took under a year to process, largely due to the reported iron-clad prenup the pair signed prior to their 2009 nuptials.</p><p>While Tom has been linked to several famous women since separating from Gisele nearly two years ago, including Emily Ratajkowski and Irina Shayk, he reportedly isn’t in a committed relationship, unlike Gisele, who found love with her personal trainer, Joaquim Valente, shortly after the divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-tom-brady-really-feels-about-gisele-rsquo-s-new-relationship>How Tom Brady Really Feels About Gisele’s New Relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tom-brady-and-gisele-bundchen.jpg><p>Despite maintaining a low profile about their romance, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed by PEOPLE in February that they were indeed a couple</a>, with reports indicating they began dating in June 2023. The initial encounter between Bundchen and Valente occurred when the supermodel enrolled in jiu-jitsu classes at his academy back in 2021. Notably, Bundchen was still married to Brady at the time, though reports emphasize things between Gisele and Joaquim didn’t turn romantic until after her marriage ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reports suggest Tom struggled to see Gisele move on so publicly, but he’s ultimately accepted that their relationship is over. Gisele filed for divorce shortly after Tom declared he was un-retiring from the NFL, only weeks after saying he was leaving the sport. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gisele has said she wasn’t consulted in his decision</a> and her choice to leave their marriage came after years of feeling like she was sacrificing her career.</p><p>“Tom has been dating and is all about growing from his relationship with Gisele and moving it to a place where they can co-parent,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told Daily Mail</a> about how Tom has been dealing with Gisele’s new relationship. “If she wants to have people think she has been dating Joaquim only since June, so be it, but they have been together longer and they aren’t taking it slow. Tom has accepted it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdl7%2BisNhmnaWZpaPBtHmQcGSmoZyhtrC6jKaYp6uZpLturculnKCdlKHGbsHPrJytZZeewKa4xGakqK6VmXqwuoynnLBlkqTGp77InqWdZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
