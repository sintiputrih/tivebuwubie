Chandler called Phelps "genetically superior," before slamming his doping allegations by responding, "Even he says that he never competed on a level playing field, inferring doping, and they still could not beat him." She added, "that moment of watching and hearing him say those things, it felt like a literal slap in the face. I felt like I was good enough to love, lay with and be with, but not be respected or allowed in the women's sport of swimming – like I was not a woman, but rather an alien or God-knows-what."&nbsp;</p><p>Chandler then weighed in on the controversy herself, telling the publication there "need to be standards for trans women in sports," but on a "case-by-case and sport-by-sport" basis.
