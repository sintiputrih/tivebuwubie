The ‘Real Housewives of Atlanta’ star claims her ex would “flaunt” his affairs.</h2><p>Drew and Ralph met in 2013 when she promoted her role as T-Boz in the TLC biopic Crazy Sexy Cool: The TLC Story. Soon after meeting, they began dating and married in 2014 following a three-month courtship.</p><p>Ralph is a father figure to Drew’s son from a previous relationship, <a href=#>Josiah</a>, in 2015.

After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> confirmed the split, the outlet uncovered Drew’s amended divorce complaint, in which she said she was done with Ralph’s “continued blatant disrespect and mental abuse.”</p><p>And while Drew has said on the show she didn’t know if her husband ever cheated on her, she said in her legal paperwork that she had proof of Ralph being a “serial cheater and adulterer” during their relationship.</p><p>She claimed he “allowed his multiple paramours to have direct contact” with her and even screenshotted several “texts” between the mistresses and Ralph as a way to “flaunt” the affairs.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Drew also claimed Ralph was “physically aggressive” with her, which he denied.</h2><p>Just when we thought Drew’s allegations of Ralph’s infidelity were all the mess we would receive, Drew accused her estranged husband of physically hurting her. According to Drew’s legal paperwork (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RadarOnline</a>), Ralph became “physically aggressive” in February 2023 by allegedly grabbing her phone out of her hand, causing her to fall at their home.</p><p>The “Already Know” singer said Ralph then yelled at her while she was on the floor and told her he was entitled to her phone because he was the one footing the bill. Drew’s lawyer said she attempted to call 911 on Ralph, but “no police ever showed up.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Drew Sidora (@drewsidora)</a></p></figure><p>Drew's legal docs say that Ralph’s alleged aggression caused her “a reasonably justified apprehension for her emotional health, and for the mental and emotional health” (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>). She also said she considered uprooting her children and herself to Chicago after their fight to be with her parents.</p><p>Ralph has since denied his wife’s account of his being violent. Radar Online's March 2023 report notes that he objected to Drew’s infidelity claims and “hopes to resolve” the rest of their divorce in an amicable fashion and work to preserve the sanctity of the parties’ private lives.”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta airs Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledGao6mgXZi1pq3TZqanZZSnsrh50Z6YpWWYpMK0sdairZ6rXaSzbq3TpZinrJE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
