In addition, the Lakers hitman earned the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2016–17 season.</p><p>However, Westbrook’s greatest fulfillment comes from his family, despite his successful career. The NBA star is happily married to his wife, Nina, and they share three children: his son,<strong> Noah</strong>, and twins, <strong>Skye</strong> and <strong>Jordan.</strong></p><p>The Los Angeles Lakers point guard, and his wife met long ago before becoming the global stars they are today. The couple met at the University of California during a college basketball game.</p><p>Westbrook proposed to Nina in 2014, shortly after they began dating, and the couple walked down the aisle a year later. <a href=#>Their relationship</a> has gone on to experience many high moments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=a-lovely-family><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_LOVELY_FAMILY></span>A LOVELY FAMILY<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Russell Westbrook’s wife, Nina, wasted no time in embracing motherhood. Two years after their marriage, the couple announced the birth of their son, Noah. Their twin daughters, Skye and Jordan, joined the family two years later.</p><p>Russell Westbrook’s kids are obviously a big part of his life. From his social media posts, one could tell that the basketball starman enjoys being a dad.
