It’s an eco-friendly (not to mention wallet-friendly) way to protect yourself and others when going outside while adhering to the CDC’s recommendations, of course. But many of Us are wondering: In order to keep our masks as sanitary as possible, how often do we have to wash them and what’s the best way to do so?</p><p>Official guidelines state that you should be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cleansing your mask regularly</a>, which depends on the frequency it is being used. If you’re stepping out once per day for essential errands, then it’s safe to say that washing the mask daily is sufficient. The CDC states that machine-washing is a suitable method to clean your cloth mask, but if you don’t have easy access to a washing machine in your home, then hand-washing it in your sink with some detergent could work as well.</p><p>If you need to leave your home slightly more often and don’t have extra time to wash your mask right away, there are products on the market that can help you out. We should all be minimizing any excursions as much as possible, but if your place of employment is still open or a member of your family requires some form of assistance, this may be hard to do. In that case, you can use an antibacterial mist specifically meant to disinfect a variety of fabrics and other surfaces on the outer layer of a mask. Check out three products below that may be able to help you stay as safe and clean as possible!</p><p><strong>This Coconut-Scented Antibacterial Mist</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Diva-Stuff-Anti-Bacterial-Travelers-Mist-with-Alcohol-60-Coconut-Scent.jpg><p>This spray contains just the right percentage of alcohol, and is meant to be used as a pillow mist and antibacterial travel companion.
