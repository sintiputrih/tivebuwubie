However, with such a high-maintenance career in comedy and the pressures that come with fame, they have managed to keep their personal lives very private from everyone around them.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Elaine, who has been the family's backbone through Dave's high-flying career and the associated pressures of fame, remains a rock for her husband through thick and thin.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Elaine Chappelle</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Elaine Chappelle is of mixed race and was born in Brooklyn, New York. She lived in the city until she was in junior high when she went to a private school somewhere in Maryland.

This speaks to the fact that they are hands-on parents who want their children raised in a stable, wholesome environment.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Even with all his fame, the Chappelle home is rooted in humility and solitude. Elaine has been committed to their family, and Dave has constantly supported the two's private lives.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Dave Chappelle is married to Elaine, and although she may not be as famous as her husband, she</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>certainly holds vital importance in his life. Dave would be the first to tell you that his career has had many ups and downs, but fortunately, he knows he can always count on her unending support. Dave and Elaine have balanced their careers and family life by keeping details of their personal lives out of the media glare, resulting in a tight, durable marriage.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6eyt7HApaCnn12ptaZ50q2mq7FdpLNusMCvnGabmJa9sbHLpZysZaees6Z5xKWYoqaVYrCprc%2BpnKWklWKubq%2FLqKqeql2hvLC3jJqrZqyYmrazecuorZ5lo6m8s8WMmqWdZZaWuqq42Gajop6V</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
