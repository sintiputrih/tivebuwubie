I prep myself as though I’m this Olympian getting ready for this big sport and I’m super healthy.”</p><p>Amelia, 22, went on to reveal that she geared up for<a href=#> fashion’s biggest event of the year</a> by maintaining a clean diet and getting plenty of beauty sleep.</p><p>“The couple days before, no alcohol, lots of water, lots of sleep, sleep is number one. Last night I had a good nine hours, which was major, and I just surround myself with good people, good vibes, good energy,” she said.</p><p>Based on Amelia’s final reveal at the Met Gala, it’s safe to say that her hard work paid off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Amelia-Gray-Says-She-Prepped-for-the-Met-Gala-Red-Carpet-Like-the-Olympics-02.jpg><p>Inspired by Belle from Beauty and the Beast, she walked the red carpet in a strapless yellow mini dress by the brand Undercover. The dress cinched in at the waist before ballooning out into the shape of a bell jar that contained red roses, a nod to the enchanted rose from the Disney movie.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Amelia’s flower-filled dress perfectly fit <a href=#>this year’s theme</a>, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion,” as well as the event’s official dress code, which was “Garden of Time.”</p><p>As the daughter of <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> stars <strong>Lisa Rinna</strong> and <strong>Harry Hamlin</strong>, Amelia was practically born into the entertainment industry. She began her <a href=#>modeling career</a> at just 16 years old when she opened and closed Dennis Basso’s SS18 show in September 2017.</p><p>She has been modeling for big name brands ever since, including Vivienne Westwood, Givenchy, Versace and Miu Miu.
