I did SNL, and then when we kissed in scene, it was just a vibe," she said during a confessional interview, per <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-dishes-on-relationship-with-pete-davidson-says-she-made-the-first-move/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>. "And I was like, 'Oh, s---. Maybe I just need to try something different!'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Though she was interested, Kardashian said that Davidson came across as indifferent toward her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"But Pete does not come to my after-party—everyone was at my after-party—[he] does not give me the time of day, so a few days later, I called the producer at SNL and was like, 'Hey, do you have Pete's number?' And they were like, 'Yeah,'" she said. "I text him. I wasn't even thinking like, 'Oh my God, I'm gonna be in a relationship with him.' I was just thinking, 'Heard about this BDE [big d--- energy], need to get out there, I need to jumpstart my …'"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Kardashian added, "I was just basically DTF [down to f---]."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While talking to her sisters about their romance, Kardashian said it might be easy to assume that a relationship with the former SNL star is "a hysterical comedy show at all times." But, in reality, their relationship is "just normal."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I never knew you can be just so happy watching TV series and going to the gym [with] someone I thought had never even gone to the gym or been to the gym before," she said, later adding, "Pete has got to be literally the best human being I've ever met, like the best heart. People always say, 'Oh, he's so funny.' ... That's like, fourth on my list of why I like him. Always wants the best for people, can handle anything, always does it with grace. He's really, really thoughtful, and humble, and just so genuine. I would say the perfect word to describe Pete is genuine."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Being with Davidson has allowed Kardashian to embrace her natural self. "I actually don't care if I go out like this and have no makeup on," she continued. "It's the most refreshing feeling."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The mom of four also talked about their bond over skin care, specifically recalling a sweet moment in which Davidson assisted her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I had this big pimple on my nose and I kept complaining about this pimple and being like, 'Oh my god, I have to get up and put pimple medicine on,'" she said. "One thing that we seriously have in common is we're obsessed with skincare and dermatologists and beauty products. And I fell asleep at 8:30, I was so tired, and I woke up in the morning with dried pimple medicine on my nose. He put it on for me in my sleep because he knew I really needed it to go away!"</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And of Davidson's supposed BDE? "When I turned 40, everyone said it's the best sex of your life. Grandma kept on telling me, '40s, the best sex' and I'm like, 'Okay, I'm ready!'" Kardashian shared. "And so far, [clicks tongue]."</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1025b301-1f7f-4f4b-80fe-228ddf464aff_1642017719.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" title="Headshot of Chelsey Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As an associate editor at HarpersBAZAAR.com, Chelsey keeps a finger on the pulse on all things celeb news.
