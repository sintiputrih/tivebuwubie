This show will keep you binge-watching and guessing until the gripping finale - and we're more than a little obsessed! Roll on season two!</p><h3>Boiling Point&nbsp;</h3><p id=exlJhaIrs- data-wc=58>In this intense kitchen drama, Stephen plays Andy, the once head chef of a busy kitchen who, in the miniseries, is struggling to cope with the events of the movie version - and is now at home, in a depressive state while trying to rediscover himself.
