Celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Mark Townsend</a> says that a mistake he sees his clients commit too often is detangling from the roots down to the tips. "They turn what would have been a few tangles into a knot by combining them, and then rip through them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the tool you use to detangle could also be the reason your ends split. "If you are using a brush with rough bristles right out of the shower, your hair is going to break," says Los Angeles-based celebrity hairstylist, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Laura Polko</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The fix:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Townsend recommends detangling from the ends and working your way up. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best detangling tools</a> to use for this are either a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>wide-tooth comb</a> or a <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Wet Brush</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-using-too-much-heat></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. Using Too Much Heat</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The problem:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The overexposure to heat dries out the hair, making it brittle and prone to breakage," explains Polko. "[Also,] if you're using a hairdryer you bought at a drugstore 10 years ago, you're probably doing this."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The fix:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swap your hot tools for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>ones with multiple heat settings</a>, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>T3 Airebrush Duo</a> which has 15 heat and speed settings for every hair type and texture. "Using these things helps hair retain more moisture and therefore help your ends last longer," says Polko. However, if you want to hold on to your favorite tool, make sure you're using the right temperature for your hair. "I tell my clients not to go over 325 to 350 degrees at the most," adds Townsend.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-skipping-heat-protectant></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3.

"It puts a layer of either panthenol or silicone in between the hair and the heat, so it really protects your hair," he says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-towel-drying-wet-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. Towel-Drying Wet Hair</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The problem:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Towels have tiny loops of cotton," explains Townsend. "They're so absorbent because your hair gets caught in between them and the cotton takes all the moisture out. The reason hair gets so matted and tangled is because all those tiny little loops rip open the hair cuticle." Yikes!</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The fix:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, use your hands to press out excess water from your hair before wrapping it up in either a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>microfiber towel</a> or an old T-shirt. Townsend explains that the reason microfiber tools are so good is because the cotton has a polyester coasting over it which softens the loops. Additionally, he says that the fibers are so much smaller than those of regular towels, that hair doesn't get in between them and cause those rips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-picking-at-split-ends></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. Picking at Split Ends</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The problem:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When you pick them, you're splitting the hair and leaving the end more fragile than it was before," says Polko. Townsend agrees that it's the worst thing you can do for your ends: "You're pulling them apart even more instead of taking care of the split end."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The fix:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Get frequent trims for the best results, but in a pinch, use a sharp scissor to execute a quick, clean cut slightly above the split.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>6.

"Since your ends are thinner than at your root, they really don't need that much shampoo," says Townsend, adding that putting your tips into constant direct contact with it can cause your ends to dry out faster.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The fix:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Concentrate on shampooing at your scalp. "As the shampoo runs down the length of the hair, it cleanses it enough," explains Townsend.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Y2K Beauty Is Back So Here Are 10 Hairstyles That Aren't Cringeworthy</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-skipping-conditioner></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7.

"Many clients that tell me they don't use conditioner because they fear it's going to weigh their hair down," shares Townsend, adding that if used correctly, it doesn't.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The fix:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Even if you have very fine hair, at least the bottom three inches should have a coating of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>conditioner</a> on them. You have to make sure to get moisture in there — it won't weigh hair down," he promises, and recommends the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Dove Intense Repair Conditioner</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-going-too-long-in-between-trims></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_67-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>8. Going Too Long in Between Trims</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_68-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The problem:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it's a myth that getting frequent trims will make your hair grow faster, skipping them all together will make your hair shrink. Townsend explains that this happens because with time, the split end will travel up the cuticle and break off.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>The fix:</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_72-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Both Polko and Townsend recommend getting a trim once every three months. "Hair typically grows between a quarter-of-an-inch to half-an-inch every month. So every three months, cut off a quarter of an inch," recommends Townsend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2ejpbmqwIyepZ2rXZiutr%2FErA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
