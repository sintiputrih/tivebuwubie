It was discovered that Larry Hornberger, a close relative of mine who had been given a cancer diagnosis, had passed away.
We discussed the events that occurred to us as children. Every every week of the summer and every single break from  school, we spent there with our grandparents."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Just like his brother Bill is, having him around the house was like having another brother. It was like having a second brother to have him around the house. I’m sobbing for him as well as for myself.</p><p>I hope that now that you are gone, Larry, you can finally rest in peace.</p><p>Your Mommom, Poppop, and Aunt Lillie, who is also known as your Mama, are eagerly anticipating your arrival at the compound’s entrance. Sometimes people will refer to your Aunt Lillie as your Mother. Till we meet again as a group, please be sure to keep a close watch on all of our loved ones. Please remember him and his family in your prayers at this trying time. There will be a lot of people who mourn the absence of Larry from their life.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
