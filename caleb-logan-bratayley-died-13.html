The 13-year-old’s mother wrote on Instagram that he died Thursday of natural causes.
“This has come as a shock to all of us.

Since Caleb’s death, however, they have paused their daily vlog uploads.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">“We know you tune in to watch each day and eagerly anticipate new videos, but ask that you bear with us while we deal with this tragedy as a family,” his mother wrote on Instagram. “Please help us honor our baked potato.”</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The family shared a video Saturday evening that was taken the day before he died, in which Caleb discussed what he’d like to ask his future self. (“Is Taco Bell still around? … Are there any new sports?” were his answers.) The next day, they shared a montage of Caleb and his two sisters through the years, which included scenes from his baseball game earlier in the week and moments from a docu-series he and his family were making with ABC News-Lincoln Square Productions about the American Revolution and the 2016 presidential race.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">The Bratayleys are associated with Maker Studios, a Disney-owned digital company. Disney is also the parent company of ABC News.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv"><strong class=vtka>"Yesterday at 7:08PM Caleb Logan Bratayley passed away of natural causes.
