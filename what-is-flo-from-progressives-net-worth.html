Recommended Videos One of television’s most recognizable mascots, Flo debuted in 2008 and has been a mainstay in commercials for almost 15 years.

She is by far best known as Flo, however, and continues to helm nearly every commercial and advertisement put out by the insurance company.</p><p data-characters=238 data-current-count=238 data-injectable=false>Over the course of more than a decade, Flo has appeared in more than 100 advertisements.
