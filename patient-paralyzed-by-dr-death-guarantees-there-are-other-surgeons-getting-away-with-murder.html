suspected cocaine habit during his residency and career.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In July of 2011, he started working at&nbsp;Baylor Scott & White Medical Center – Plano, where he stands accused of severely maiming and even killing several patients.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One was left in a wheelchair with loss of function along the left side of his body after bone fragments in his spinal canal, while another, while another died after he severed a major artery in her spine but continued operating as she lost blood. A third suffered a severe infection when Duntsch left a&nbsp;surgical sponge&nbsp; in his neck.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One of his victims was a friend who became a quadriplegic and died from complications earlier this year — yet still, bad outcome after bad outcome, Duntsch continued to operate on patients.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Kenneth Fennell, 78, was also among Dr. Death’s victims. In November of 2011, he was operated on for back pain, and&nbsp;Duntsch told him it went well — though he’d find out later that the doctor operated on the wrong part of his back.&nbsp;</p><p
