However, O'Donnell's first stint on The View was marked by controversy. O'Donnell's claims about everyone from Donald Trump to Kelly Ripa made headlines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another celebrity O'Donnell had an opinion about was Paula Abdul. The former <a href=#><strong>American Idol</strong></a> judge was being scrutinized during that time due to what many perceived to be odd behavior. Some speculated she was on drugs and others believed she was an alcoholic.</p><p>O'Donnell certainly seemed to believe these rumors, as evident by her comments. These comments would eventually lead Abdul's spokesperson to respond to O'Donnell directly.</p><h2 id=rosie-alleged-paula-was-drunk-and-sipping-on-alcohol-during-39-american-idol-39>Rosie Alleged Paula Was Drunk And Sipping On Alcohol During 'American Idol'</h2><p>While serving as moderator of the Hot Topics table on The View, <a href=#>O'Donnell made her feelings toward Abdul clear</a>.</p><p>"Paula was very thirsty last night," O'Donnell said. "That girl was sipping Coke every shot. And toward the end of the evening, one eye was wandering."</p><p>Jeff Ballard, Abdul's spokesperson, denied she had a drinking problem. This came after videos from interviews Abdul did via satellite began going viral. Abdul was slurring her speech and seemingly acting bizarre.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ballard chalked Abdul's behavior up to fatigue.</p><p>"She was exhausted," Ballard told Reuters. "This was at the end of three days of press interviews and appearances, and she has had cameras following her around for a reality TV show too."</p><p>That reality show, Hey Paula, only sparked further speculation on Abdul's state.</p><p>"She was sitting in a room with just a camera and a mic on, and the controllers dropped the sound twice, which is why she rolled her eyes."</p><p>Abdul canceled all scheduled interviews the following day, citing a sore throat.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Paula Abdul Tried To Quit American Idol Eight Times On Her First Day</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She never drinks," Ballard said. "I have known Paula Abdul since she was 13, and I have never seen her drink ever in my life. ... And no, she is not on any kind of medication."</p><p>This didn't stop O'Donnell from making the same remark the following day on The View. During a Hot Topics segment, a clip from American Idol was played. The clip showed a bad audition, after which the contestant was made fun of and rejected by the judges.</p><p>"That's compassion for you," O'Donnell said. "Isn't that what America thinks is entertainment, to make fun of someone's physical appearance? And then, when they leave the room, laugh hysterically at them -- three millionaires, one probably intoxicated."</p><h2 id=rosie-came-after-paula-again-while-writing-about-her-on-a-blog-post>Rosie Came After Paula Again While Writing About Her On A Blog Post</h2><p>Following the release of Hey Paula, Abdul's personal health was more focused on than ever. Her behavior was being closely scrutinized and mocked constantly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>O'Donnell's first hosting gig on The View already ended by July 2007. However, she still managed to find a way to let the world know what she thought of Abdul. Her way of expressing her views was through her blog, which she usually wrote in haiku style.</p><p><a href=#>O'Donnel wrote</a>, in part:</p><p>right now</p><p>paula abdul would yell action</p><p>and the result would be</p><p>what we all see</p><p>there r times</p><p>u r so broken</p><p>fragile</p><p>pain filled</p><p>love less</p><p>desperate</p><p>raw</p><p>vulnerable</p><p>so needy for love …</p><p>hey paula</p><p>we cringe</p><p>at r selves</p><p>thru u</p><p>In 2009, <a href=#>Abdul spoke to ABC's Nightline</a> and denied she ever abused prescription drugs. She also denied consuming alcohol before American Idol tapings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Never," Abdul said. "I’ve never been drunk in my life. I don’t like it. It’s not my thing. Spending money on clothes and shoes, that’s another thing."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49841192.jpg><p>Abdul was then asked if she ever took pain medications such as Vicodin or Oxycontin.</p><p>"No, no, no, no, no, will not take those drugs," she said. "And you can check my medical records, there is nothing like that. I was never on Oxycontin or Vicodin or anything like that. I was on nerve medicine and anti-inflammatories."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kelly Ripa Spontaneously Called Into The View To Confront Rosie O'Donnell About Comments She Made About Her On Air</a></span></p><p>Abdul also answered to those who suggested she wasn't "really there" on her reality show Hey Paula.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Because I’m falling asleep and a camera is on me. I don’t have anything that is shameful. I don’t have anything to be embarrassed about; that was NOT accurate documentation of my life."</p><h2 id=paula-39-s-spokesperson-responded-to-rosie-and-told-her-to-mind-her-own-business>Paula's Spokesperson Responded To Rosie And Told Her To Mind Her Own Business</h2><p>Even though Ballard, Abdul's spokesperson, attempted to clear the air on Abdul's behavior, O'Donnell was still talking. By August 2007, Abdul finally had it with O'Donnell's claims and decided she had gone too far.</p><p>In a blog post, O'Donnell speculated that Abdul was suffering from Parkinson's Disease. This was apparently the last straw for Abdul, who responded to O'Donnell's claims via Ballard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar48473924.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This is absolutely ridiculous and untrue that Paula has Parkinson's," <a href=#>Ballard told Extra</a>. "Rosie's been the object of rumors herself and I would think she would be more responsible about starting them herself."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Whatever Happened To Paula Abdul After She Left American Idol?</a></span></p><p>He continued, "Paula considers Rosie a friend. She's been to Paula's house. They've had dinner, and personally I think Rosie should mind her own business."</p><p>O'Donnell's people also spoke to Extra, saying, "She's not feuding with Paula. She's just stating her thoughts on her blog."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXZeytcPEnqVmqp%2BotqZ5zp2mp6aVoblurc2dZKmZpaGubq3BnaylZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
