In the clip, the blonde bombshell giggles (and accidentally suffers a nip slip!) as she transforms into her Santa-obsessed alter ego, Courtney Cane. In one particularly steamy shot, Stodden — dressed in a low-cut red romper — leans over Santa Claus and coos into his ear: “Hey, it’s Courtney Cane."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I like that,” she says. “Yeah, I like that. It’s like a little birdie.”</p><p>In several other moments, Stodden repeatedly says the line “Hey, it’s Courtney Cane,” as she writhes around in barely there ensembles — including a dark green bikini trimmed with white fur and, what else, mistletoe.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Courtney Stodden" width=1000 height=614 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Naturally, the song’s lyrics match the nearly NSFW aesthetic of the video. Some of the most outstanding innuendo-laden lines include: “I really like the taste of your peppermint stick,” “You can slide down my chimney anytime” and “I wanna puff on your pipe all night.”</p><p>Stodden tells <i>Us</i> that she created the video to spread a little bit of cheer before the new year.&nbsp;“I wanted to put something out there this holiday season that would make people giggle,” she says.”I feel levity is needed for Christmas 2016.”</p><p>During a December 16 interview with <a href=#>Fox News</a>, the Washington native said that her lifelong crush on St. Nick inspired the track and its accompanying visual.</p><p>“‘Mistletoe Bikini’ is basically a song about how I’ve always had a crush on Santa Claus ever since I was a little girl,” the <i>Celebrity Big Brother</i> U.K. alum explained. “The song [and video] is about my crush and you know, maybe a little later in the video we have an affair behind Mrs. Claus’ back. It’s fun and it’s really catchy.”</p><p>Stodden, who is married to 56-year-old <b>Doug Hutchison</b>, suggested that she has always had a thing for Santa because “he is an established older man that would bring me toys.”</p><p></p><p>Watch the BTS clip at the top of this post and check out the entire “Mistletoe Bikini” video above.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJ6oZZKpwG67xWaaqK2iqbumxYysq6iclJq7tHnNrJ2wZZ2ewLW4xK2mnmWSnriqushmpK6rmZh6t7XDnqZmr2RqhHSCj2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
