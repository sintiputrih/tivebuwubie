She is currently the WWE Women’s World Heavyweight Champion.</p><p>Recently, she visited Australia along with <a href=#>Dominik Mysterio</a> to promote the upcoming Elimination Chamber Premium Live Event.

For me, when I first came in for the first May Young Classic, I had the long blonde hair. I smiled way too much. Way too bubbly. It wasn’t me. The person that you see today is the person that I was back then. But I was trying so hard to be someone else because of obviously the people that I watched growing up. I thought that’s what they wanted. So that’s what I gave them. I didn’t feel comfortable and after a while, I wasn’t getting put on shows. I wasn’t getting opportunities, I was getting beat down and picked on. They didn’t think I worked hard enough.</p><p>“But I was just trying to give them what I thought they wanted, but at the end of the day, the best thing you could do is just be confident with the person that you are. So once I decided not to care what people thought about me. I was like, ‘I’m going to be myself.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-rhea-ripley-this-is-my-brutality>Rhea Ripley: This is my Brutality</h2><p>Mami also shared that this is her real personality and being herself helped her to become one of the biggest stars in WWE.</p><p>“Cut my hair short… And once I did that and started wearing the long pants with the chains and the studs… Changed my persona, came out and I was just mean mugging everyone, beating everyone up. ‘This is my brutality,’ it’s not even a joke. It’s what I did. That’s when my career really started rocking and rolling. And the Rhea Ripley evolution that you have seen into the Rhea Ripley that you see today is just me growing as a person outside of the WWE and I’m just letting it shine through within the WWE sort of thing. So, it’s me. And I think that’s what the fans see and that’s what gravitates them towards Rhea Ripley.” Rhea Ripley said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNsaGpxZ2K%2FqbHAZqmiqJyaxm6x16mjmqGeqHq1tMRmnK%2BnnKrBqrvNZqCnrJ9iuqK5yA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
