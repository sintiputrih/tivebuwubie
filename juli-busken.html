The name Juli Busken is etched into the history of the University of Oklahoma, but not for the reasons anyone would have hoped. Let’s delve into the life, the crime, and the aftermath of Juli Busken’s story.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Juli-Busken-Wikipedia-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Life_of_Juli_Busken></span><strong>The Life of Juli Busken</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Juli Busken was a bright and promising 21-year-old dance student at the University of Oklahoma. She had just graduated from her last semester and was on the cusp of stepping into a world full of dreams and possibilities. Juli was originally from Arkansas, and she had come to Norman, Oklahoma, to pursue her passion for dance and further her education.</p><p>However, her life took a tragic turn on December 20, 1996. On that fateful day, she was kidnapped from the parking lot of her Norman apartment complex. The world was about to witness a crime that would send shockwaves through the community.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Horrific_Crime></span><strong>The Horrific Crime</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Juli’s life was cut short in the most brutal manner imaginable. Her lifeless body was discovered near a lake in southeast Oklahoma City, with the horrifying signs of rape and a gunshot wound to the back of her head. It was a crime that left a scar on the hearts of those who knew her and anyone who heard about the tragedy.</p><p>For years, justice seemed like an elusive dream. The case remained cold, and Juli’s family had to endure the unimaginable pain of not knowing who had taken their beloved daughter away from them.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Break_in_the_Case></span><strong>The Break in the Case</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As the years passed, hope began to dwindle. But then, a glimmer of hope emerged. DNA evidence from the crime scene finally matched a name – Anthony Sanchez. At the time, Sanchez was already behind bars for burglary, but the evidence pointed to him as the perpetrator of this heinous crime.</p><p>The breakthrough in the case allowed the wheels of justice to start turning. Anthony Sanchez was brought to trial for the rape and murder of Juli Busken, a trial that would ultimately change the course of his life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Anthony_Sanchez_Maintained_Innocence></span><strong>Anthony Sanchez Maintained Innocence</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Throughout the trial and even up to his final moments, Anthony Sanchez maintained his innocence. He adamantly proclaimed, “I am innocent,” and in his last breaths, he uttered, “I didn’t kill nobody.” These words hung heavy in the air as he faced the ultimate punishment – execution by lethal injection.</p><p>His conviction and execution, despite his claims of innocence, raised questions about the justice system and the finality of such a punishment. It’s a somber reminder of the complexities and flaws that can exist within the legal system.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Impact_on_Juli_busken_Family></span><strong>The Impact on Juli busken Family</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the execution brought some sense of closure for Juli Busken’s family, it was a bittersweet moment. The family’s attorney expressed that it was long-awaited justice for Juli. However, none of the family members were reportedly present at the execution, highlighting the enduring pain they carried.</p><p>For them, justice was served, but it couldn’t undo the loss they had suffered nearly 27 years ago. The memory of Juli Busken lives on through her family and all those who knew her, and her story serves as a stark reminder of the preciousness of life and the devastating impact of violence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Final_Moments_and_Last_Meal></span><strong>Final Moments and Last Meal</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the lead-up to his execution, Anthony Sanchez was given the opportunity to have a final meal. His choice was chicken fried steak, fried okra, mashed potatoes and gravy, a roll, sweet iced tea, and apple pie with vanilla ice cream. It was a simple meal, perhaps a reflection of the gravity of the situation and the weight of his actions.</p><p>Sanchez became the third prisoner to be put to death by lethal injection in Oklahoma that year, marking the end of a chapter in a long and painful legal process.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span><strong>Conclusion</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The story of Juli Busken is a tragic one, a life cut short under the most horrific circumstances. Her memory lives on through her family, friends, and the University of Oklahoma community. The execution of Anthony Sanchez may have brought a measure of closure, but it also raises important questions about the criminal justice system and the profound impact of such cases on all those involved.</p><p>As we reflect on this somber chapter in Oklahoma’s history, we are reminded of the importance of seeking justice, but also of the enduring pain that remains long after the legal proceedings are over. Juli Busken’s story serves as a poignant reminder of the need for compassion and support for the victims and their families who are left behind in the wake of such senseless acts of violence.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=FAQ></span><strong>FAQ</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=rank-math-question><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Anthony_Sanchez></span><strong>Who is Anthony Sanchez?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Anthony Sanchez is an individual who was found guilty of raping and murdering a University of Oklahoma student named Juli Busken in 1996.
