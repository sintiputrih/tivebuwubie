This album contained a more pop-oriented sound than his previous work.[1] Despite only earning a gold certification from the RIAA, it accounted for three more hit singles. First was “Love Working on You” at No. 14, followed by “Cover You in Kisses” at No. 3 and “Hold On to Me” at No. 4. Despite having several of his singles cross over to the pop charts, “Hold On to Me” was his first Top 40 pop hit, reaching No. 33 on the Hot 100.</p><p>Montgomery’s last Warner Bros. release was 2004’s Letters from Home. Although the lead-off single, “Cool” failed to chart, the first single of Montgomery’s career not to chart, the title track became his biggest crossover hit with a No. 2 country and No. 24 pop peak. Despite the success of this single, the album’s third and final release, “Goes Good with Beer”, peaked at No. 51, and after its release, Montgomery exited his label.</p><p>On February 16, 2006, Montgomery was arrested at an intersection in&nbsp;Lexington, Kentucky&nbsp;for&nbsp;driving under the influence&nbsp;and possession of a&nbsp;controlled substance, which was identified as&nbsp;Endocet&nbsp;by the&nbsp;Lexington Herald-Leader. Police also found two loaded handguns in Montgomery’s vehicle. Montgomery was charged with a count of a prescription drug not in its proper container, two counts of carrying a concealed deadly weapon, disregarding a traffic control device, and performing an improper turn.</p><p>In late 2008, Montgomery founded his own label, Stringtown Records. That year, he released his next album, Time Flies. This album produced three singles: “Mad Cowboy Disease”, “If You Ever Went Away”, and “Forever.” Although the first two both failed to chart, “Forever” peaked at No. 28 on the country charts, representing his first chart entry in over four years. Mad Cowboy Disease reached No. 17 on Mediabase’s Satellite Radio chart. He also sang duet vocals on the title track to Colt Ford’s debut album Ride Through the Country.</p><h2 id=block-b2e911fa-028d-4d0c-aa12-c89061d1d180><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-aboutjohn></span><span id=Frequently_Asked_Questions_AboutJohn>Frequently Asked Questions AboutJohn </span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><strong class=schema-faq-question>Who is Montgomery?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>John is an American country music singer.
