Choosing to embark on the path of marriage at a young age, they tied the knot when Leslie was just 17 years old. Ethan Hawke entered the world a year later, becoming a part of their lives.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>At the time of Hawke’s birth, both of his parents were students at the University of Texas at Austin, illustrating their commitment to education even as they navigated the responsibilities of parenthood.

Following the separation, Ethan Hawke was primarily raised by his mother, Leslie.</p><p>Their life took them on various journeys as they relocated several times before finding stability in New York City. It was in the bustling city that Hawke attended the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, shaping his early education.
