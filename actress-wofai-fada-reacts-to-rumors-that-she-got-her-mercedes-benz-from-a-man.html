They also think that successful ladies do different (unwholesome) things for money. When I got to Lagos, I didn’t have where to stay. If you give me (as little as) N5,000 now, I would save it. I don’t know how to be extravagant. I like to save as much as I can because of the fear of going back to the level I was. When I got my (Mercedes Benz) G- Wagon, people said a man must have given it to me but that’s not true. I guess a lot of women face such claims but it would have been better if they said God gave me. “God has been the one helping me and I just wish everyone would give Him the glory. I was turned down by a lot of people and some known celebrities but now, those people are my colleagues in the industry. I only wanted those people to give me a platform to shine, not money. I honestly didn’t think things would work out well for me. I’ve always believed in myself but didn’t see it coming this fast.”</p><p>Wofai Fada said that the fear of her becoming poor again pushed her or to go all out and become successful.</p><p>She said;</p><p>“When you’re consistent, you would have your own audience. With the support of social media, I kept pushing and I’ve become more innovative. When I started my skits, it was just for fun. I didn’t even know how to make money on Instagram then. Over time, I didn’t want to be known only as an Instagram celebrity, so I had to think of something else and that’s why I opened a restaurant. New comedians are evolving, so if one doesn’t innovate, one would become stale.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpqaraqVqMBuw86fmKJllpaxonnRnpicrKNiwbB50a6kqKqjYsGprdNmqqGdXZy8tXnHnqlmpZWnsKawxKxkm52er3qnvs6mZJplnZa7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
