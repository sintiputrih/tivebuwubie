It’s safe to say Chris Rock’s brief time on stage at the 2022 Oscars stole the show after Will Smith got visibly angry over his Jada Pinkett Smith joke.
The 57-year-old comedian made a quip about the 50-year-old actress — who has alopecia — starring in G.I. Jane 2, a joke about her shaved head. After she rolled her eyes, Smith, 53, subsequently stormed thestage at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles and hit Rock."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Most recently, she shared a video of her head in December 2021 via Instagram.</p><p>“Now at this point, I can only laugh. Y’all know I’ve been struggling with alopecia and just all of a sudden one day, look at this line right here. Look at that,” she said before putting a positive spin on the situation. ”But you know mama’s going to put some rhinestones in there. I’m going to make me a little crown. That’s what mama’s going to do.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Rock has used Pinkett Smith as a punch line at the Oscars. Back in 2016, he made waves when he mentioned her in his opening monologue at the awards show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Jada got mad, said she’s not coming. Jada boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting<strong> Rihanna</strong>’s panties. I wasn’t invited,” Rock said. “You get mad. It’s not fair that Will was this good and didn’t get nominated. It’s also not fair that Will was paid $20 million for Wild Wild West. This year at the Oscars, things are going to be a little different. In the ‘in memoriam’ package it’s just going to be black people who were shot by the cops on their way to the movies. Yes, I said it, all right?”</p><p>Earlier during Sunday’s show, meanwhile, cohost <a href=#><strong>Regina Hall</strong></a> joked about the couple having an open marriage, which the pair laughed off.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKasm5GnwG5%2Bj2tpZq%2BZobluv8yiq6FlmJ7BtHnCoamiq12nvKS3jKitnqpdn66lrYygZKJlmpa7pnnJqKKeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
