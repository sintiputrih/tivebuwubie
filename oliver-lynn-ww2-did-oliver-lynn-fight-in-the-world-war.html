He was referred to as “Mooney” since his line of employment was selling moonshine. The townspeople referred to him as “Doolittle” because they thought he wasn’t “doing much,” which his wife Loretta abbreviated to “Doo.” At a pie event, Lynn, who was 21 at the time, and Loretta Webb, who was 15 at the time, met. They got hitched a month later.</p><p>The couple moved to Custer, Washington after a year as Lynn looked for better employment prospects. The pair had three kids by the time his wife became 19 years old. The twin sisters Peggy and Patsy, Betty Sue, Jack Benny, Clara Marie (“Cissy”), and Ernest Ray were the children born to the Lynns during their marriage (the latter named after Patsy Cline). Betty Sue Lynn passed away in 2013, and Jack Benny Lynn predeceased his parents.<br>In 1953, Lynn gave his 21-year-old wife a guitar as a wedding anniversary present and encouraged her to perform at local bars and on neighbourhood radio.</p><h2>Oliver Lynn WW2: Did Oliver Lynn fight in the world war?</h2><p>Yes!
