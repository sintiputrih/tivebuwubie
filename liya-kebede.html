Kebede served as a High-Level adviser for the Center for Global Development's 2009 report "Start with a Girl: A New Agenda for Global Health".</p><p>Kebede launched Lemlem, a clothing line, in 2008. Lemlem, which means "to bloom" in Amharic, features hand-spun, woven and embroidered women and children's clothing.

In one health center that the foundation works with, hospital deliveries rose by over 50% in 12 months.</p><p>In 2003, Kebede was named the newest face of Estée Lauder cosmetics, the only Ethiopian to serve as their representative in the company's 57-year history. Her contract was rumored to be worth $3 million. At this time in Kebede's career, she was ranked #1 on models.com.</p><p>Kebede's big break came when Tom Ford asked her for an exclusive contract for his Gucci Fall/Winter 2000 fashion show. Then in May 2002 she was on the cover of Paris Vogue, which dedicated the entire issue to her.</p><p>In 2000, Kebede married Ethiopian hedge fund manager Kassy Kebede.
