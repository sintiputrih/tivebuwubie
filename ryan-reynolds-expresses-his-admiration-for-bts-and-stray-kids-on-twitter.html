The event was discovered after fans of the band noticed the posts on his Twitter account’s Likes section. It didn’t come as a surprise, given that he had previously expressed his affection for K-pop groups, but it caught them off guard.</span></p><p><span>BTS’ Jimin’s concert countdown post was one of the two tweets the actor liked. The idol captioned two selfies with “D-4.” Wait a little longer. #JIMIN #PTD ON STAGE SEOL #IfWeAreTogeth WeDontNeedPermission.”</span></p><p><span>The other was a Stray Kids fan translation account that was live-tweeting leader Bang Chan’s Chan’s Room Ep. 147. During the live stream, the idol discussed the gift he received from Reynolds: a bottle of Aviation American Gin, which he co-founded.</span></p><p><span>The leader stated that the gin’s smell was too powerful for him, so while he doesn’t drink it because it is a “prized property,” he does take a whiff of it whenever he is sleepy.</span></p><p><span>Reynolds and Stray Kids became acquainted after the actor noticed a fan edit video. A clip from Deadpool has been linked to a scene. From the group’s Deadpool-inspired performance of God’s DDU-DU DDU-DU on Mnet’s Kingdom.</span></p><p><span>The actor then sent the leader a signature Aviation Gin, who sent him an autographed record. Fans were pleasantly surprised when the star subscribed to his Bubble account.</span></p><p><span>Reynolds previously revealed that he was a BTS fan by liking Jungkook’s exercise video. Though the actor did not state it, the group’s tweets convinced followers he was an ARMY member.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>BTS And Stray Kids</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Ryan Reynolds</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipspmeYr%2Bmxc2oo52rXZrFsb7ErKqeq12dtrR5wJ2koqqRqbawuoyfpqtlkqnAbq3NnWSsrKKWxm63yJ2qZqeeYsG4tdOtnKtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
