And is there any truth to the claims of ghost sightings at Myrtles? Go inside the eerie story of this supposedly haunted house.</p><h2>The Beginnings Of The Myrtles Plantation Before The Alleged Hauntings Began</h2><p>The Myrtles Plantation started out as a piece of land purchased by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Bradford</a>, a general of the American Revolutionary War. Here, he built a house in 1796 and named the place “Laurel Grove.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-162280 alt="The Myrtles Plantation In Louisiana" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/myrtles-plantation.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-162280 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>National Register of Historic Places/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Myrtles Plantation house in St. Francisville, Louisiana today.</span></p><p>Fleeing justice for his role in the so-called Whiskey Rebellion of 1791-94, Bradford built the house in what was then a Spanish colony.</p><p>He lived there alone for several years until he was officially pardoned by U.S. President John Adams in 1799. He then brought his family to live on his new plantation.</p><p>After Bradford’s death, the grove&nbsp;passed to his daughter and her husband,&nbsp;Clarke Woodruff. But their life there wasn’t a happy one. Of their three children, only one survived to adulthood.</p><p>It was during the time that the Woodruffs lived on the Myrtles Plantation that we get the first glimpse of alleged paranormal activity.</p><h2>The Legend Of Chloe, Ghost Of The Myrtles</h2><p>As the popular story goes, Clarke Woodruff was known as an honest man. Yet, he had one fatal flaw: an insatiable appetite for sex. It wasn’t long before he focused his attention on one of the slave girls on the plantation: Chloe.</p><p>The young girl knew that refusing Woodruff’s advances would not be wise: she’d immediately be punished by working long hours under the blistering sun, or worse. So, not having much choice in the matter, she began a sexual relationship with Woodruff that lasted for a few years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-482695 alt="Inside The Myrtles" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inside-the-myrtles.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-482695 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Anne G/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>The Fannie Williams room inside the Myrtles Plantation house.</span></p><p>Worrying that Woodruff’s wife would find out and punish her, Chloe began eavesdropping on the family’s conversations all around the Myrtles Plantation house. One day, Woodruff caught her listening and ordered her ear cut&nbsp;off as a punishment. From then on, Chloe was forced to wear a turban to cover her disfigured ear.</p><p>Understandably, Chloe wanted revenge. One night, when the family was about to sit down to dinner and Woodruff was away, Chloe allegedly slipped a bit of poison into their food. Within days, Woodruff’s wife and two of his children were dead.</p><p>The other slaves, afraid that Woodruff would find out what Chloe had done when he returned, took the matter into their own hands.</p><p>They grabbed Chloe and hung her from a nearby tree. When she finally died, they cut her body down and threw it into the river.</p><p>According to legend, Chloe’s spirit lived on, haunting the Myrtles Plantation. However, this story would not become widespread until many decades later.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-249059 alt="Myrtles Plantation House" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/myrtles-plantation-house.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-249059 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Shanna Riley/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>The house at Myrtles Plantation, a popular site for ghost hunters to this day.</span></p><h2>The Trail Of Death At The Myrtles Plantation Continues</h2><p>In 1834, Woodruff sold the Myrtles Plantation to one Ruffin Gray Stirling. Stirling not only remodeled the house but also renamed the plantation after the crepe myrtle trees that grew on the property.</p><p>Sometime after, the plantation passed to William Winter, a man who married one of the daughters of Stirling.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-482697 alt="The Myrtles Plantation House" width=900 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/the-myrtles-plantation-house.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-482697 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Michael McCarthy/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>Stories began circulating that the Myrtles Plantation house was haunted not long after it was built at the tail end of the 18th century.</span></p><p>Then, in 1871, an unnamed man shot Winter in the chest as he was exiting the house. He allegedly ran back into the house and stumbled up the stairs before dying in the arms of his wife Sarah.</p><p>After this, Myrtles continued to pass through different hands. It wasn’t until much later that something unnatural allegedly began occurring at Myrtles Plantation.</p><h2>Paranormal Activity In Recent Decades</h2><p>It would take until the 1970s when Myrtles Plantation was purchased by the Meyers family, that its reputation as a haunted house would come about. The family opened the plantation as a bed and breakfast and it didn’t take long for strange things to take place.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-482696 alt="Myrtles Plantation House Interior" width=700 height=1054 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/myrtles-plantation-house-interior.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-482696 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Corey Balazowich/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>The supposedly haunted mirror inside the Myrtles Plantation house.</span></p><p>For starters, guests at Myrtles Plantation reported hearing strange noises. Others saw ghostly apparitions, often of a young girl wearing a turban.</p><p>Many suggested that this might be the spirit of Chloe, which by this point had become a full-blown local legend. Then, in 1992, the owner of Myrtles Plantation supposedly caught her on film.</p><p>That year, she took a photo of the property to help get an insurance policy for the house. The photo was quickly forgotten until three years later when a researcher asked to use it for a postcard. After blowing it up, he allegedly noticed the figure of what appeared to be a young girl.</p><p>According to the owner, there was no one in that spot that day.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-162279 alt="Ghost Of Chloe" width=900 height=609 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/chloe-myrtles-plantation.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-162279 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Fortean Slip/ Youtube</span><span class=caption-body>Alleged photo of the ghost of Chloe at Myrtles Plantation with the figure circled.</span></p><h2>Other Rumored Ghost Sightings At Myrtles Plantation</h2><p>The vengeful ghost of an abused girl sounds scary enough. Yet, if other sightings are to be believed, she’s not the only paranormal resident of the Myrtles.</p><p>Some people claim to have seen young girls in old-style clothing in the windows. Others say that they’ve caught glimpses of Woodruff’s children appearing in the mirror near the room where they died.</p><p>Worse yet, according to another local legend, Myrtles Plantation was actually built on top of an old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Indian burial ground</a>: a common idea in tales of paranormal activity.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-482701 alt="The Myrtles House" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/the-myrtles-house.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-482701 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Andrew Nicolle/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>Some say the Myrtles house was built on top of an ancient Tunica Indian burial ground.</span></p><p>Indeed, some people report seeing the spirit of a Native American woman in a gazebo on the property. Presumably, she is one of the people buried here long ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, others have reported seeing William Winter, the only man we know for certain was killed at Myrtles Plantation.</p><p>According to this story, Winter’s ghost relives his last moments by loudly staggering through the house’s entrance and running up the stairs to the 17th step where he allegedly met his end.</p><p>Some people even claim to have caught the ghosts on film. Although some of these photos are undeniably spooky, they look somewhat grainy and raise suspicions over their authenticity.</p><h2>Is The Myrtles Plantation House Really Haunted?</h2><p>Indeed, the ghost stories and tales surrounding Myrtles Plantation have some factual problems. For starters, Chloe almost certainly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t exist</a>.</p><p>The Woodruffs never recorded owning a slave by that name. And though Woodruff’s wife and children did die, they weren’t poisoned.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-482700 alt="Exterior Of The Myrtles Plantation House" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/exterior-of-the-myrtles-plantation-house.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-482700 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Andrew Nicolle/Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>The Myrtles has been featured on several ghost-hunting shows in recent decades.</span></p><p>Like many people in colonial Louisiana, they succumbed to yellow fever. In fact, many of the more gruesome events that are supposed to have happened in the house, like the ten murders allegedly committed there, also seem to be made up.</p><p>Of course, anywhere with as much history as the Myrtles Plantation is bound to pick up a few legends over the years.</p><p>Is that enough to say that strange things don’t happen at Myrtles Plantation? There’s only one way to find out. If you’re up to it and ever find yourself in Louisiana, you could always spend the night.</p><p>After this look at the Myrtles Plantation, step inside <a href=#>Los Angeles’ supposedly-haunted Cecil Hotel</a>.
