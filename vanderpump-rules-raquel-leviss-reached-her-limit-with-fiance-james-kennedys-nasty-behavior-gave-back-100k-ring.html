But she knows she needed to move on from James for good,” they added.</p><p>Diving deeper into the cause of their split, the source explained: “Watching this season back, Raquel had already reached her limit with James’ behavior and she’s tolerated so much.&nbsp;</p><p>“He promised he’d be better and he promised he’d change for her and watching the show back, she seemed to finally&nbsp;see how nasty he is to not just others but to her as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“Making fun of her looks and basically only appreciating her physical beauty. I think she just had her limit and realized she cannot fix him.</p><p>“And even if they got married, they would get divorced. And she didn’t want to deal with that.”&nbsp;</p><p><h3 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h3></p><a href=# class="rail_anchor_text css-1m4l212"><span class=css-7eo7xt><img decoding=async alt="Tommy Fury OUT of Jake Paul fight just days before grudge match" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SPORT-PREVIEW-FURY-PAUL.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span></a><p>Earlier this season on the show, James was seen mocking Raquel for getting a nose job as well as consistently making comments on her looks.&nbsp;</p><p>Tension reached an all-time high on Friday – when Andy Cohen and the Bravo cameras flew to Los Angeles to film the season 9 Vanderpump Rules reunion.&nbsp;</p><p>“She gave him the ring back at the reunion. They talk about everything there [on camera] and it’s really emotional for everyone, not just those two.&nbsp;</p><p>“But basically everyone is in tears from the cast,” the source said of the difficult situation.&nbsp;</p><p>The insider added the split was even a “surprise” to their friends after they dated on-and-off since 2016.</p><h2>BIG BLING RING</h2><p>In May, James, 29, <a href=#>got down on one knee</a> alongside his cast mates in the Coachella desert to propose to his then-girlfriend of five years.&nbsp;</p><p>Raquel, 26, said “yes” to a stunning six-prong solitaire diamond that’s estimated to be “at least” three karats and worth “over $100,000,” jeweler Mike Fried previously told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Page Six</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Their romantic proposal – which was planned by costar <a href=#>Tom Sandoval</a> to resemble the real Coachella music festival – aired just weeks before it was revealed the two called it quits.&nbsp;</p><p>Yesterday, the duo shared identical statements on their&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;pages announcing their breakup to their followers.</p><p>Alongside the same photo of the pair, the TV stars wrote: “After these 5 wonderful years we had together, we decided we have two different goals and made the decision to call off the engagement.</p><p>“We love each other very much, but we aren’t in love anymore. We want nothing but the best for each other so please keep any thoughts positive. Sending Love.”</p><h2>SUBSTANCE ABUSE STRUGGLES</h2><p>James and Raquel have faced their fair share of challenges in their relationship, as the DJ has suffered from addiction and substance abuse issues.</p><p>However, he has maintained that he has stayed sober in recent years – largely crediting Raquel for helping him stay clean.&nbsp;</p><p>He was also accused of cheating on Raquel in season five of the show and once again by a separate woman named Hope in season seven.&nbsp;</p><p>The musician later lost his job at SUR, being fired on camera by Lisa Vanderpump, due to his bad behavior on several occasions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/SPORT-PREVIEW-FURY-PAUL.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000698549023.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000698252959.jpg><p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Vanderpump Rules stars James Kennedy and Raquel Leviss reveal they’re engaged</span></p><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>We pay for your stories!</h3><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Thesun.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnppa7pbHRqaymqF2nwq2x0mapmqmlmrluuMSvoKyrXaeyoq%2FHnptmoJWneq21zKKrZq%2BZqbVussiapZydXZ%2BurrHSZqKepp6asbq%2FjKeYrKypYq%2BmtMCvoKiqXZyut7GMm5ico11mfXG3jKugp59f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
