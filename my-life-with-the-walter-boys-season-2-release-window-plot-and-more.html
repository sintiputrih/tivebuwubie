The series immediately shot up in popularity, both on Netflix, and across social media. Within days of its premiere, My Life With the Walter Boys claimed the top spot on Netflix’s Global English Top 10 TV List, with over 20 million views. Furthermore, it reached the Top 10 in 88 countries across the world. This alone was proof that a second season was surely going to be greenlit.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 2’s release window</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@netflix href=#>@netflix</a><p>My Life with The Walter Boys has been renewed for Season 2!</p><a title="♬ original sound - Netflix - Netflix" href=#>♬ original sound – Netflix – Netflix</a></figure><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>There is currently no release date for season 2 of My Life With the Walter Boys, and fans needn’t hold their breath for a quick turnaround. However, if season 1 is anything to go by, then we can set our sights on a December 2024 release. One year is enough for both filming and production to end (right, Netflix?)&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=452 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>To ease the torture of having to wait a whole year without Jackie and the wholesome Walter family, Netflix released the cutest video showing the cast’s reaction to the news of the renewal. The video shows the main cast of the show, Ashby Gentry (Alex Walter), Noah LaLonde (Cole Walter), and Nikki Rodriguez (Jackie Howard) during a photoshoot. Their session is interrupted by a call from showrunner Melanie Halsall, who breaks the good news to them.</p><h2 id=h-what-to-expect-from-season-2 data-injectable=false>What to expect from Season 2?</h2><p data-characters=91 data-current-count=91 data-injectable=false><strong>The rest of this article will reveal spoilers for season 1 of </strong><strong>My Life With The Walter Boys.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=391 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=521 data-current-count=912 data-injectable=true>It’s not too hard to guess that season 1’s messy love triangle might be front and center in the upcoming season of My Life With the Walter Boys. The show’s creators most likely also play up the “Team Alex or Team Cole” drama in the marketing for season 2, so you can expect those tensions to reach a boiling point. At the moment, there have also been whispers that some members of the main cast are developing an extra close relationship off-screen. Guess we’ll have to wait and see how that goes.</p><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>However, what everyone is waiting for is how the show’s creators hope to resolve the season 1 cliffhanger. The season ended with Jackie fleeing back to New York after leaving an “I’m sorry” note for the Walter brothers. The worst exit of all time? Perhaps! Alex had just confessed his love to her before leaving for rodeo training camp, and she’d just shared a kiss with Cole. So there’s quite a lot of terrain to cover on 2 of My Life With The Walter Boys.</p><p data-characters=128 data-current-count=128 data-injectable=false>The melodrama will surely be intensified, and perhaps Jackie will be forced to finally pick a side after her self-imposed exile.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yuxYyloJ%2BdXay2tbSMrZ%2BeZaeWubWx0WaZqLGjYsCmrdKopWZqXaeyrbHArJxmr5mjsbDDjKmjqKxdlrulecyoqZ5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
