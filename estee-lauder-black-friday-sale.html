Black Friday 2021 lands on Friday November 26 — and as ever, falls on the day after Thanksgiving.</p><p>An American tradition originally to mark the start of the festive shopping season, it's become a massive event worldwide, with the UK really going for it in a big way over the past few years.</p><p>Bargain hunters should keep an eye out for deals from the start of November, as many retailers kick off their sales early.</p><p>Following Black Friday, the deals normally continue online over the weekend too, with Cyber Weekend followed by Cyber Monday.</p><h2>When is Cyber Monday and will Estée Lauder be taking part?</h2><p>Cyber Monday falls on Monday November 29th this year and we expect Estée Lauder to take part.</p><p>Look out for special offers and free gifts from Estée Lauder.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">More Amazing Black Friday Deals</h3></p><ul id=block-e723824e-f173-4688-b4e8-b85d939c10a9><li><strong>Best Black Friday deals</strong></li><li><strong>Selfridges Black Friday deals</strong></li><li><strong>Amazon Black Friday deals</strong></li><li><strong>Currys Black Friday deals</strong></li><li><strong>John Lewis Black Friday deals</strong></li><li><strong>Argos Black Friday deals</strong></li><li><strong>Very Black Friday deals</strong></li></ul><h2>Is Estee Lauder cruelty free?</h2><p>The Estée Lauder Companies were one of the first cosmetics companies to stop animal testing as a way of assessing cosmetic product safety more than 30 years ago. Estee Lauder claim to not test their products on animals, and to not hire third parties to do so either.</p><p>That being said, it is worth noting that Estee Lauder still sells its good in countries where&nbsp;animal testing on cosmetics is required by law. <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Peta</a> therefore believes that by doing so, they are not a cruelty free brand. We think that everyone will have to make their own choice on this matter.</p><h2>When is the next Estee Lauder gift time at Boots?</h2><p>Boots says it doesn't have a confirmed the event this year, but you can keep updated on all the current offers <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p>We will also update this page as soon as new information is out, so make sure to keep an eye out.</p><h2>Which Estee Lauder cream is best?</h2><p>For dry and normal/combination skin, we love the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">DayWear Moisturiser</a> with SPF 15 and if your skin is on the oily side, then opt for the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">DayWear MATTE Moisturiser</a>. To activate moisture defences while you sleep, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Nutritious Super-Pomegranate Moisturiser</a> is the one, and it's also suitable for all skin types.</p><h2>How much does Estée Lauder delivery cost?</h2><p>Estée Lauder offers free standard delivery to members or when you spend over £65 - otherwise it's £2.95 and takes between two to five working days.</p><p>If you'd like next day delivery it's £6.50, while there's also the option of named day delivery for £4.95, Saturday delivery for £10.50 or free click and collect.</p><p>Check out the site's <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shipping page</a> for more details</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More Black Friday 2021</h2></p><p>Enjoyed our round-up of the Estée Lauder Black Friday sale?
