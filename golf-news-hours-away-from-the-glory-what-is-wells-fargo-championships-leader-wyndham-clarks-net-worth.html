Though the golfer has never cherished a professional victory before, he is only a round away from enjoying a $3.6 million check. But before Clark gets his hand on the trophy, how much is the net worth of the tournament’s leader?</p><p>Wyndham Clark turned pro back in 2017. He played amateur golf for Oklahoma State University before being transferred to the University of Oregon in 2016. Though the 29-year-old has yet to claim a professional win, his six-year wait is on the verge of ending at the Quail Hollow Golf Course in Charlotte, North Carolina. But before his possible triumph in Wells Fargo Championship, let’s take a look at how much the golfer’s worth.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>How much is Wyndham Clark’s net worth?</h2><p>Though Clark has never won a professional event in the past, he is among the rising golfers in the world. He currently ranks at the 80th as per the OWGR standings, while being placed at 36th position in FedEx Cup standings. Deeming to his decent finishes in the PGA Tour, Wyndham has earned plenty of earnings from the sport.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-05-06T220913Z_140124473_MT1USATODAY20609762_RTRMADP_3_PGA-WELLS-FARGO-CHAMPIONSHIP-THIRD-ROUND.jpg><p>Wyndham Clark’s career earnings currently stand at $7,405,024. However, the golfer represents Power Design and Titleist brands during his golf outings, but the monetary deal between the entities is publicly unknown. As of 2023, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Clark’s net worth stands</a> at $4 million.</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><b>‘Death Penalty’: Golf Fans Left in Disbelief as Dangerous Chemical Spill Sends a Scare to the PGA Tour</b></a></strong></p><p>Nonetheless, his earnings will soon further increase following his <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>$3.6 million victory at the Wells Fargo Championship</a>. Perhaps it could be the beginning of Clark’s new phase in professional golf. Still, with another round left for the Arizonan-born golfer, can he capitalize on the lead at the Quail Hollow Golf Club?</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Can Wyndham Clark win his maiden PGA Tour event?</h2><p>Ahead of the commencement of the PGA Tour event, DraftKings Nations labeled Clark as an underdog at +6000 to win the elevated event. However, hours before the final round in Charlotte, Wyndham is among the favorites to win the event at +650 betting odds. The Cinderella story began for Clark at Wells Fargo Championship with back-to-back 4 under-par rounds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023-05-06T220957Z_891413377_MT1USATODAY20609778_RTRMADP_3_PGA-WELLS-FARGO-CHAMPIONSHIP-THIRD-ROUND.jpg><p>Nonetheless, his highlight of the tournament came during the third round when he scored -8. Wyndham Clark amazed the fans with stunning 8 birdies in the penultimate round, which helped him secure the top spot of the leaderboard. As he looks to head to the final round, Clark would love to imitate his performance from his third round and bag home his maiden PGA Tour victory and $3.6 million.</p><p>Will Wyndham Clark manage to win the elevated event?
