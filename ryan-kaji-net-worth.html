The videos have also been criticized for promoting unhealthy foods.</p><p>As a result of the complaint, the FTC sued YouTube and Google for $170 million, and YouTube has since changed its rules to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunC%2B2JqlZqORn7ZuusStZLCnoqm1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
