People will come for you and start hating on you for no reason. Kai literally stays in his on lane. Even the people in his community"</p><p>Another user wrote, "That part about Bruce sucked to see cause you could see how disappointed Kai is in how that situation went. Hopefully that gets hashed out in the future. But, man I can’t believe this is a brand new podcast. It already feels pretty polished. Yachty does a really good job as a host and the editor was cracking me up with all the images and text he put at the bottom.
