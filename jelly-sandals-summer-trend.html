My mom obviously shopped for me, but I did get to have some input and would style my outfits before bed every night. And for a long time, every single summer outfit revolved around <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>my favorite accessory: jelly sandals</a>. Almost all of them had a hint of glitter in them, as they should.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jelly sandals are, without a doubt, a huge '90s trend that's also absolutely controversial — which is honestly to be expected of shoes that look as though they are made of jello. People love to hate on them, and last summer there wasn't a single person that wasn't shocked by their unexpected comeback.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">British designer Alexachung's second collaboration with footwear brand Juju — which launched in May 2020 — featured floral embellishments on its jellies and won over social media almost instantly. Then, Gucci released <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the now best-selling rubber slide sandals</a> a year later. Even Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen's The Row had itstheir own take on the trend with a pair of sandals that. They <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim" data-affiliate-link-rewriter="u1=${REQUEST_ID}-${DOC_ID}">obviously retail for nearly $1,000</a> and are made of leather instead of anything remotely jello-looking, but the inspiration is still there. Jelly sandals' popularity makes sense when you consider that they're reminiscent of a time that isn't 2020/2021 (a.k.a a better time).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Blake Lively was recently seen out with Ryan Reynolds</a> in New York wearing a pair of jelly sandals, which is proof that the trend is here to stay this season. Lively made a strong case for the controversial sandal in a long floral dress and gold jewelry. It was essentially what summer would look like if it could be an outfit. And the good news is, jelly sandals are probably the least expensive summer trend of all time; you can find <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a pair for just $9 on Amazon</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In conclusion, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Crocs</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Birkenstocks</a> have some competition. And just imagine how proud middle school you would be of a summer outfit styled around jelly sandals in 2021. Let's just say, my summer mood board may or may not feature some photos of my outfits from under the age of 10. As it should.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shop the controversial celeb-approved sandal trend, below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yrsculsGarkaOxorjSZqqupZ2av27A0Z6lnQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
