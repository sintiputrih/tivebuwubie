Similar to other YouTubers like <a href=#>Dream</a>, Kwite films his video in a disguise. He is usually seen wearing sunglasses and a surgical mask with a dark green hoodie over his head.</p><p>Occasionally on Instagram, Kwite will share a photo of him without the mask and glasses, but will scribble his face out in green. That said, have we ever seen Kwite's face IRL?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Has Kwite ever shown his real face?</h2><p>No, Kwite has never revealed his face to his fans. However, he appears to be thinking about it. On Tuesday, Feb. 21, Kwite tweeted "69,000 likes and I'll face reveal?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The tweet, now days old, received under 15,000 likes, which is less than a quarter of the likes Kwite had asked for.</p><p>That said, it doesn't look like he'll be showing his face anytime soon. However, even if he was to garner enough likes, there is no way of actually knowing if he was being serious about the face reveal.</p><p>In 2018, he posted a video dubbed "face reveal," which featured his friends. But to the chagrin of Kwite's fans, he did not unmask himself. His friends, however, dressed up as him and did their own face reveals.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kwite has been accused of sexual assault in the past.</h2><p>The day after Kwite tweeted about doing a face reveal, one user claimed on Twitter that Kwite had sexually assaulted them. "I refuse to be silent any longer," tweeted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@nyasputiin</a>.</p><p>In a Twitlonger <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a>, @nyasputiin claimed that they had been raped by Kwite in February 2018. They also noted that they had been in an "extremely toxic friendship/on and off relationship" with Kwite since 2017.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>@Nyasputiin shared that the two originally bonded in the early days of Kwite's channel, when he had "less than 500 subscribers." But as Kwite became more popular, his behavior apparently started changing toward @Nyasputiin. During one of the few times they hung out together, @Nyasputiin detailed how Kwite had allegedly raped them. @Nyasputiin also accused Kwite of emotional abusing, gaslighting, and deadnaming them during the past six years.</p><p>Kwite has yet to respond to the allegations.</p><p><strong>If you need support, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visit </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>RAINN.org</strong></a><strong> to chat online one-on-one with a support specialist at any time.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoMSqwMRmqZ6ZnGKzoq%2FE</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
