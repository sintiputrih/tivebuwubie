“My heart breaks for my brother who’s no longer with us but it rejoices knowing he’s with his fellow warriors in Valhalla drinking and fighting with Odin,” Mykelti, 27, captioned an Instagram photo of Garrison and her daughter, Avalon, 2, on Monday, March 11. “I hope he is loving his place amongst the stars.”
Calling her late half-brother “the funniest person in the room” and “one cool dude,” Mylkelti, who is the daughter of Christine Brown and Kody Brown, expressed her sadness that her children “will never be able to experience” Garrison’s “fun presence."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It finds a way to push through any seal. There’s no way to stop it. Sometimes you have to let yourself sink inside of it before you can learn how to swim to the surface.”</p><p>The second quote, from the <strong>C.S. Lewis</strong> book The Four Loves, read, “To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken.”</p><p>Mykelti’s tribute came the same day Garrison was <a href=#>laid to rest</a> during a funeral held by his family. <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> confirmed on March 5 that Garrison died at age 25 of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p><p>Kody, 55, and <strong>Janelle Brown</strong> addressed their son’s death in a statement shared that same day. “He was a bright spot in the lives of all who knew him,” the exes wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “Our loss will leave such a big hole in our lives, that it takes our breath away. We ask that you please respect our privacy and join us in honoring his memory.” (Kody and Janelle, 54, also share Logan, 29, Madison, 27, Hunter, 27, Gabriel 22, and Savanah, 19.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Several Sister Wives stars have spoken out following Garrison’s death, including Christine, 51. “Garrison was a wonderful, <a href=# rel>caring brother</a>&nbsp;who understood Truely’s need for a hobby and built her a flowerbed,” she wrote alongside an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> video of Garrison working with her youngest daughter, Truely, 13, at her home. “We’ll miss him forever.” (Along with Truely, Kody and Christine are the parents of Aspyn, 28, Paedon, 25, Gwendlyn, 22, and Ysabel, 20.)</p><p>Kody’s ex <strong>Meri Brown</strong> called Garrison “<a href=#>a bright spot</a> in the lives of all who knew him” via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>. “This loss will leave such a big hole in our lives, and it takes our breath away,” she continued. “We ask that you please respect our privacy during this time and join us in honoring his memory. Garrison, you are loved and will be missed! 💙💙.”</p><p>Garrison’s sister Maddie also <a href=#>paid tribute</a> to her late brother one day before his funeral. “My words seem to fall short. Our hearts our broken and we are now swallowed with the love now left behind for this beautiful brother 🩵,” she wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Sunday, March 10. “God be with you till we meet again. I’ll see you at the gates of Valhalla, feasting with our ancestors who battled before you. Until then, we must live in a more gray world without the light you brought.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoaOpsrN51qKtnqtdosasscutoGaaoqTEr3nPmrCsZaSntqPB055kraddoa61sYybqaismJq%2FbrPAq6miq5%2BjfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
