Katie Couric is reflecting on the downfall of her former Today coanchor, Matt Lauer, nearly two years after he was ousted by NBC over several sexual misconduct allegations.
Couric, 62, addressed the matter during the Dress for Success annual Women Who Inspire breakfast in New York City on Wednesday, November 6. “As you can imagine, I’ve thought a lot about this over the last two years because it has been, to use the phrase that many have used, a reckoning,” she began, according to Variety."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

After his firing was announced, the <a href=#>New York Times</a> and <a href=#>Variety</a> published reports that contained several more accounts of alleged sexual misconduct on Lauer’s part.</p><p>At the time, Lauer’s <a href=#>Today</a> colleagues <a href=#><strong>Savannah Guthrie</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> announced the axing at the beginning of their live broadcast, where the pair grew emotional reporting on the scandal.</p><p>The New York native, meanwhile, issued a statement in response to the accusation. He admitted he was “truly sorry,” but he also claimed that “some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Additional allegations against Lauer appeared in <a href=#><strong>Ronan Farrow</strong></a>’s book, Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, in October. In Farrow’s tell-all, several women claimed NBC was aware of the allegations facing Lauer — and disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein used his knowledge of this to pressure NBC News into a killing a story about his own misconduct.</p><p>Months after the initial allegations surfaced in 2017, Couric opened up about <a href=#>how challenging it was for those who knew Lauer</a> personally to deal with the news of his alleged misconduct.</p><p>“It’s been a very painful time for a lot of people who worked with Matt, knew him, really care about him and who never witnessed — or experienced — any of this behavior that’s obviously being talked about,” she said on <a href=#>The Wendy Williams Show</a> in May 2018. “I don’t know the full extent of all these things happened. But I can only talk about my personal experience and I was always treated respectfully and appropriately.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSesm6vzq6poptdoq61wIylmK6domLBtr7Nnptmp6WperW7jJucZmpdq7KzxYydoJ%2Belaeyr8CMqZyoqJyafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
