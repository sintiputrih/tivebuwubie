We still have two weddings and a reunion to get through. Like many group chats across the U.S., the Vulture staff congregated in a Slack room dedicated to gossip — #netflix-mess — to share our predictions on how this glorious train wreck will end. Will Stacy and Izzy choose love and live in poverty? Will Milton and Lydia pass the SWOT analysis? Will someone please throw fists at the reunion? We get into all of it.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clnhog7nb001f3b8072jqbg5o@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Do Lydia and Milton get married?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/a7e/9cc/df5eb31f2ff7cacc0ce40b850a9fdf765c-milton-and-lydia.rhorizontal.w700.jpg><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholk80001m3b80eml7ti7v@published data-word-count=31><strong>Morgan Baila</strong>: I say no. Lydia is the one to call it off because he calls her too emotional and she realizes he’s too young. He goes, “Eh, whatever,” but cries.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoh001t3b80jv2zqmni@published data-word-count=49><strong>Anusha Praturu</strong>: I agree! Milton should say no, but Lydia is the one with the actual cojones to do it. She knows Milton isn’t ready for marriage. Milton will be heartbroken, but hopefully by the time the reunion comes around, he’ll be ready to admit that Lydia was right.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoh001u3b80w1w0hpq9@published data-word-count=66><strong>Dee Lockett</strong>: My educated guess is that Lydia will come to whatever sense she has and pull the plug on this in some dramatic “I’m enough for me” moment, as her arc has been building toward very unsubtly all season. And you know what? Yes, girl. Any age is too old to be marrying a man who leaves a plate of leftover food on the couch!</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoi001v3b80oyfjb7hf@published data-word-count=58><strong>Savannah Salazar</strong>: I think Milton will follow Lydia’s lead. If she goes first, they’ll both say no, but if he goes first, he’ll say yes. Either way, they won’t get married. I get the feeling Milton thinks marriage is just next on the checklist after graduating college and getting a job, even if he does care for Lydia.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoi001w3b80xvrous2h@published data-word-count=37><strong>Alejandra Gularte</strong>: I don’t think they will get married, but Milton is the one to call it off at the altar. He’ll call it his “gut” feeling that he’s not supposed to go through with the wedding.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoi001x3b80n2qrvbsk@published data-word-count=11><strong>AP</strong>: Alejandra, I think Milton is too analytical for gut feelings.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoj001y3b80rj88r87x@published data-word-count=16><strong>AG</strong>: He’s a <a href=#>Pokémon Master</a>, of course he has them!

His mom and sister’s words will be ringing in his ears.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoj00203b808g2mmzrh@published data-word-count=20><strong>Kathryn VanArendonk</strong>: I think Milton says no because his mom sat him down and made him do a SWOT analysis.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoj00213b80aohi0zim@published data-word-count=66><strong>Nic Juarez</strong>: I can see them both saying yes. I don’t know that Milton is fully ready, but he does seem to love Lydia and has a good head on his shoulders. He wants to get married, even if he doesn’t seem to fully grasp the weight of marriage. And Lydia is down for the cause. If he commits to her, she’ll SHOW UP for them.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyoj00223b804jhvm38z@published data-word-count=59><strong>Julie Kosin</strong>: I absolutely see them both saying yes. Lydia is intent on marriage and family, and I think she knows Milton’s a good guy, even if he does, to Dee’s point, leave food on the couch and open wine bottles with his teeth (icon behavior, sorry). They both say yes. Furthermore, they are happily together at the reunion.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnholyok00233b80y9rpypuu@published data-word-count=4><strong>SS</strong>: Wow, Julie.

Unfortunately, they hate Johnie too much to let their very real incompatibilities stop them from “winning.” They’ll last until at least the reunion, but if Izzy doesn’t boss up by the time the spotlight fades, I don’t think Stacy is keeping him around.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnhotoed002o3b806g3br22l@published data-word-count=54><strong>AG</strong>: Yes, even if she feels like she’s making a mistake, she’s already been too vulnerable with him. She was willing to accept him at his best (in the pods) and his worst (his credit score). She’s established enough to overcome the financial stuff. They’ve also proven to each other that they are ride-or-dies.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnhotoed002p3b80ogt9co27@published data-word-count=34><strong>NJ</strong>: They do not give ride-or-die energy, in my opinion. Not at all. Lydia and <a href=#>Chelsea</a>, those are ride-or-dies. Stacy had too many conditions to be ride-or-die. She’s more of the “or die” variety.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnhotoee002r3b80p14l4515@published data-word-count=109><strong>DL</strong>: I have a few theories for this one, and they all lead to a “no” at the altar or divorce after two months: Stacy ends it because her family stages an intervention at the behest of her dad and she’s not about to risk that trust fund or putting her dad in financial ruin ’cause of all that debt (and other shady shit) Izzy’s clearly hiding. Or Stacy ends it all on her own ’cause he tells one more bad lie and she bosses up. Or he calls it off because his mother no longer holds her tongue. Whatever outcome, Stacy’s already got the PJ to France booked.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnhotoef002s3b8059dgsj50@published data-word-count=30><strong>KVA</strong>: I agree they’re not together by reunion.

I think Johnie got a rough edit this season. Yes, she made mistakes, but most of her bad decisions stemmed from a place of confusion. She wasn’t ready for marriage, so the outcome, her dating Chris, was ideal.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnhp0a2n003q3b806v5bg9m6@published data-word-count=18><strong>JK</strong>: Yes.

I’m not sure we always take that into account.

Also, anything to annoy Izzy and Stacy is funny to me, so I support.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnhp0a2o003u3b80pqo04158@published data-word-count=44><strong>DL</strong>: They’re gonna reveal an engagement at the reunion, and I will be yawning. I like Johnie! Didn’t love how quickly she bought Uche’s bullshit, but she’s just impressionable. And Johnie handled Izzy and Stacy mostly well, which I think made Chris swoon harder.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnhp0a2o003v3b8001j2zzkr@published data-word-count=62><strong>MB</strong>: I think they broke up, but they’re in good places in their lives and she gets a good redemption edit in the reunion. However, I don’t think she handled that mid-season reunion fight well at all. I sympathize with her and wish her well, but I don’t think she won that Izzy-Stacy argument because she let them talk to her CRAZY.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clnhp0a2p003w3b80hjj3gaup@published data-word-count=25><strong>DL</strong>: She didn’t get petty when she could have.
