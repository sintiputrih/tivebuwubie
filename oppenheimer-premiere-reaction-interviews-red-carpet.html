Thanks to Oppenheimer's impressive marketing campaign (going together with its unlikely frenemy competitor, Barbie), I knew that this would be fairly spectacular.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJ3-53uLDC data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Emily Blunt reveals why Oppenheimer cast walked out of London premiere</a></p><p id=ecm_tozKgCZ data-wc=14><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Oppenheimer: all about the startling true story and Christopher Nolan's unbelievable A-List cast</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b4f0af9e2b3e-gf-23258r.jpg><p id=etecEASAJ0a data-wc=44>Not only was Leicester Square heaving with fans hoping for a glimpse of the stars, the atmosphere from the cast – knowing that they are promoting something exceptional, something that is going to be lauded by critics and viewers alike – was something special.</p><p id=eqSVe20uPyi data-wc=62>So, if you have never been to a red-carpet event as a journalist, this is what happens. You pick up your pass at a nearby hotel and hop-skip your way past security – usually enjoying a tiny walk on the red carpet, or in this instance the black carpet, and taking mad selfies before finding your magazine's spot on the media line.</p><p id=e3QuSThioQl data-wc=67>Since the movie is one of the biggest of the year, the media line was rammed with cameras, microphones, photographers and of course, the camaraderie chat between reporters goes quickly to which cast members you would most like to talk to, what questions you'll be asking, and whether we might need to 'huddle' together to catch answers if the stars' are in a hurry to get inside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3da078d0bf69-gf-10698msg.jpg><p id=ed9-_4LDVdq data-wc=51>This is a seriously impressive, extensive cast. Countless stars are leading men and women in their own rights, with Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branaugh and Josh Hartnett all serving as supporting characters – and that's just the tip of the iceberg.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/f3647d11f3e9-gettyimages-1540586848.jpg><p id=eeD0453CCsa data-wc=102>Like with most premieres, the interviews are a mixture of tribulations and disappointments. Unlike very rare occasions where the stars will chat to everyone, the celebrities only have so much time and limited publications to speak to. As such, I was lucky enough to snap up questions from Kenneth Branagh, David Dastmalchian and Máté Haumann – but had to forlornly watch as Florence Pugh, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr passed me by (but stopped for snaps with fans and looked fabulous). And finally, Rami Malek flew through the premiere in a hurry and ran into the group photo before greeting fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/cb074ef96cdc-gettyimages-1530059093.jpg><p id=eML-X0-Th9t data-wc=68>Chatting to me about Oppenheimer, Kenneth Branagh reflected on his biggest takeaway from his experience. "To have the privilege of working with an incredible ensemble of actors with a master filmmaker on a subject that is both important historically but also provides an amazing piece of cinema," he said. "It's great storytelling in a great medium from a master and to be involved with that, that’s so special."</p><p id=ecLFjhNW8x data-wc=67>I also loved speaking to David Dastmalchian, who spoke to me about getting into character. He explained: "Digging into the historical research and trying to figure out what I could know about him [William Borden] and his motivations, all of that informs the performance. So of course, you have to then bring yourself to the role and try and find a way to make it your own."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86b556947541-gf-15415msgr.jpg><p id=eL8PO9TE5ymK data-wc=56>As the celebs flocked inside to watch the movie (<a class=hm-link href=#>before leaving in solidarity with the actors' strike</a>) I was hopped up on adrenaline and the shared sense that we all knew we were all part of something that viewers are going to be talking about for years – so will you be going to watch Oppenheimer?</p><p id=egbD-YsitsTF data-wc=10>Oppenheimer will be released in cinemas worldwide on 21 July.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tcHBuYGd8sLzPnqWhnZmisrN5z6ucpqGVp7JuvsSamq2hn6N6qrrTnqmvoZWswG6%2BxJ1knJmipbK1ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
