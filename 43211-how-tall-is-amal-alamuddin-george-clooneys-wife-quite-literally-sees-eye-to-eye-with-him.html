George Clooney's Wife Quite Literally Sees Eye to Eye with Him</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-01-18</div><p>Guys, we need to talk a little bit more about Amal Alamuddin before we're all tired of hearing about her amazing wedding to George Clooney. And when I say amazing, I mean it was in Venice. And there were <a href=# class=T3D>tons of celebrities there</a>. And because the Oscar-winning actor and human rights superstar lawyer are too cool for that rumored fancy <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Seychelles honeymoon getaway</a>, they are actually <a href=# class=T3D>honeymooning in England and keeping it super low key</a>. Let's be real, who needs a honeymoon after all the wedding festivities were in Italy? Not these two. But the reason we need to talk about the newlywed again is because you might have on last, nagging question about her. Namely, <a href=# class=T3D>how tall is Amal Alamuddin</a>?</p><p>Coverage of the wedding got us reacquainted with just how gorgeous Amal Alamuddin really is. I'm not trying to take the spotlight off of her formidable career, I'm just trying to say that if there were an embodiment of brains, beauty, a powerhouse marriage, AND a powerhouse career... it's basically time for Beyoncé to make room for Amal Alamuddin.</p><p>Another thing I noticed about Alamuddin recently is that this girl is TALL. A lot of people thought it would take someone pretty spectacular to snag George Clooney, and it looks like it actually took someone who is literally seeing eye-to-eye with him.</p><p>Let's use the powers of Internet sleuthing to find out just how tall Amal Alamuddin really is!</p><h3>Exhibit A: Amal Alamuddin, Height Unknown</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images News/Getty Images</p></figure><p>This is the body of the awesome woman who is our subject for the day. Notice the legs, notice the torso. Notice those super cute shoes and her attendance at an event to end sexual violence in conflict. We now know exactly what we're dealing with here.</p><h3>Exhibit B: George Clooney, Height Known</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Feng Li/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>I used my super deductive and sleuthing skills (I used Google) to determine that Clooney stands at 5'11". Sherlock Holmes would be so proud.</p><h3>Exhibit C: Google Proof</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>OK, maybe Sherlock wouldn't be so proud. Thanks, Google! You're a pal!</p><h3>Exhibit D: Clooney & Alamuddin</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Andrew Goodman/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>This photo is tricky. They seem to be around the same height, but Alamuddin's dress is kicked out slightly and her right shoulder is positioned forward, making us assume that she is not standing at her full height due to her pose. I'm going to say that if they were both standing completely upright, they would both be at 5'11".</p><h3>BUT WAIT, ISN'T SHE WEARING HEELS IN THAT PHOTO?</h3><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Andrew Goodman/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>She probably is, though that dress prevents me from finding any solid photographic evidence of those heels. I knew you would catch on, you all are too quick for me to pull one over on you. Say she is wearing heels in this picture. In almost every photo I've seen of her standing next to her new hubby, it looks like Alamuddin is wearing a three inch heel that keeps her right around his height.</p><h3>CONCLUSION</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Andrew Goodman/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Well this has truly been a wild ride. We knew Alamuddin had toned legs for days but we couldn't be entirely sure until I pieced these unruly pieces together for you that Alamuddin stands at around 5'8". The mystery has been solved. You're welcome, America.</p><p>In the above photograph, they are probably discussing how one day they will get married and a writer sitting in her bedroom will try to guess how tall Alamuddin is. Did I mention besides being gorgeous and famous, this couple is psychic too?</p><p><i>Images: Getty Images</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx1f5FqaGagn6x6ta3LpWSiq12WuqK4jJqjmqWlmbGquoygnKiql5p6pLjOqKWesaNixKqyxGaorqGkmnqttdOeqZqknK56tLHErGSesZViwbB5xLKcZq%2BZqbVutMim</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
