However, language evolves in a way that changes the literal meaning of words and phrases to mean something completely different from how they started out, which is why the phrase "getting scooped" has gained new traction among different communities to mean different things.</p><p>Of course, getting scooped isn't the only phrase to adopt a brand new meaning in recent years. Others that now have <i>completely</i> different meanings than their OG dictionary definitions include <a href=# class=T3D>lit (as in getting lit)</a>, <a href=# class=T3D>woes (as in the way Drake uses it)</a>, <a href=# class=T3D>swish (as in what you say after something awesome</a> happens), <a href=# class=T3D>going ham (as in going hard</a> as a Motherf*cker), and <a href=# class=T3D>flex (as in to boast</a>).</p><p>But as for "getting scooped," that phrase is pretty unique in that it can have several different meanings — based on the context, with whom you're using it, and within what community you're tossing the phrase around in. So, without further ado, here are four different meanings of the term "getting scooped" you may or may not have heard yet:</p><h3>Definition One: To Get Picked Up</h3><p>One popular definition of getting scooped among younger people is to get picked up by car, usually by someone who is on their way to a different location than the one form where they're picking you up. You might get scooped by your friends on the way to the mall or a bar; or, if you're in the Harmonie Korine movie <i>Spring Breakers, </i>to rob a diner.</p><h3>Definition Two: To Get Your Scientific Idea Stolen</h3><p>Let's say you you're scientist (or something) and another group of scientists is using your science-y ideas to do their <i>own</i>, separate science thing, and then they <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>publish their findings before you publish yours</a>. Sounds to me like you just got scooped.</p><p>Not chill, second set of scientists.</p><h3>Definition Three: To Get Filled In On The Latest Details</h3><p>In the journalism world, to get a scoop means<a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D> to get an exclusive on a story</a>. This could be an exclusive interview or exclusive details, but either way, getting scooped in this context could be applied towards either the source who provided the journalist with the interview, or even the journalist who extracted the details and information.</p><h3>Definition Four: To Get Your Underboob Cupped</h3><p>According to Urban Dictionary, scoop in this context means "a <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>brush of the tit area</a> in a upward flicking motion," so essentially if you get scooped someone is scooping up your boobs. Note: Scooping someone in this sense shoud <i>only</i> be done if you have their express consent to do so — but if all parties agree on it, I don't see how that <i>couldn't </i>be fun.</p><p>So depending on where you are, who you're speaking to, and what you're saying, go ahead and get scooped. Or you know... don't.</p><p><i>Images: Pexels; <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Giphy</a> (4)</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfJRvbXFlp52utXnDqJysZZmpeq6xwKdkraddnLK1edKcpqiolZl6qbHRnmSaqpVigW7Ax6KloKtdqbWmedKlmKefXamys7mMnKaupJRiuqatzQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
