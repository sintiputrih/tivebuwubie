Strickland claimed that he would have sacrificed himself for Hit Row to stay in WWE.</p><p>“If it was a case of myself getting released and they were still there, I would feel better about that because I know I can go anywhere and be pretty okay and do my own thing. I felt bad for my team and I’m always going to feel like that. For Ashante the most, because that’s all he ever wanted to be, is a WWE wrestler. He went through a lot in his military life, like being bombed overseas and getting shot at and getting concussions from bombs going off and going through true war time and that trauma.</p><p>All he ever wanted to do when he came back was push hard and be in WWE. That’s where my heart went to, was him primarily in our group. If I could sacrifice myself being released for them staying there and doing their thing, I would.”</p><p>Strickland made his return to the pro wrestling world at the recent NJPW STRONG Rival taping, where he squared off against Jay White. Hit Row is set to reunite&nbsp;<a href=#>during wrestling event next month as well.</a>&nbsp;We will have to wait and see if the four talents will work in the same company again in the future.</p><p>h/t to Fightful for the quotes</p><p>February 21, 2022 12:59 pm</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX9ze49rZmtpX6jEpr7VnmSsrKKesKy4wKebZq%2BfqrmlecearZ5lo5aws7XFopqenF2dtq6%2FxKWdZp6fp3qptdNmqaivXam8br%2FTmrBmoZ5ixLixjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
