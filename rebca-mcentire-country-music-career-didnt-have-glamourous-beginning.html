McEntire addressed how her path to success didn't come quickly.&nbsp;"Baby steps, slow burn,"&nbsp;McEntire shared with host Willie Geist, describing her start in music. "Yeah, I thought once you had a record on the radio, you're rich. You know you have a tour bus, a big mansion. No, I was living in a $10-a-month rent house in Oklahoma. Had to haul our own water,"&nbsp;she added. After Geist asked&nbsp;McEntire, "What kept you going through those obstacles,"&nbsp;she replied, "Curiosity. Faith. Especially in the hard times, the bad times, the sad times. My faith. And just thinking, 'What more can we do?'"&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, McEntire's greatest hardship came several decades into her career when her mother, Jacqueline, died in 2020. Because McEntire's mom had been such a supportive force throughout her music career, she briefly considered leaving the music industry. "So when Mama passed, I thought, 'Where's my buddy? Where's my 'want-to'? She's not with me anymore,'" McEntire shared during an interview (via <a href=#>Country Now</a>). Fortunately, McEntire had a change of heart and is still working in the industry to this day. Come Fall 2023, McEntire will even join the "The Voice"&nbsp;judging panel as <a href=#>Blake Shelton's replacement</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamppZ4B6g46rnJubkWK6pLHNraCrnV2YvLa606uwZqWlqLakecKaqZ6domKxqrDNrWShmaaaeqi4wKamrqqfqsBursSgoKemmaO0cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
