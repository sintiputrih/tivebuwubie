This year’s Currents lineup includes a broad smattering from the contemporary cinema landscape, including new works from documentary auteur <a href=#>Wang Bing</a>, <a href=#>the late Jean-Luc Godard</a>, and Joanna Arnow’s provocative Cannes feature debut, The Feeling That the Time for Doing Something Has Passed. The Revivals selection includes the thematically appropriate North American premiere of an Agnès Varda documentary starring herself and rebellious filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini taking a walk through Times Square while in town for the fourth New York Film Festival. Hayao Miyazaki’s latest film, <a href=#>The Boy and the Heron</a>, will have its U.S. premiere in the festival’s Spotlight selection, together with the world premiere of Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie’s <a href=#>The Curse</a>. Bradley Cooper’s Maestro, which he co-wrote, directed, and stars in as the late composer Leonard Bernstein, is the festival’s Spotlight Gala selection. Elsewhere down the bill, Michael Mann’s Ferrari is the closing-night selection of the festival. Adam Driver and Penélope Cruz star in Mann’s biopic about the race-car manufacturer Enzo Ferrari’s mounting success and marriage troubles.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllnwvx1j002g3b6xxmtdjzrm@published data-word-count=159>Todd Haynes’s Cannes hit, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">May December</a>, will open its 61st edition, making its North American premiere at Alice Tully Hall on September 29. The news arrived just before SAG-AFTRA officially went on strike and promised the cast and director in person. The former will likely not be in attendance if the studios fail to make a deal with the actors’ union in time — so we’ll miss the electric duo that is Natalie Portman and Julianne Moore talking about the film, which tells the story of a woman’s unkosher relationship with a much younger man (Charles Melton) and the actor who’s playing her onscreen. Fine, we were robbed of that post-screening conversation, but at least we’ll get to see <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Priscilla</a>, Sofia Coppola’s Tumblr-ready passion project that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">compelled her to open an Instagram account</a>. It’s a Priscilla Presley biopic starring Cailee Spaeny in the title role and Euphoria’s Jacob Elordi as Elvis, serving as NYFF’s Centerpiece selection on October 6.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clle0izpt00243b6xbbywqv0c@published data-word-count=41>The full slate also includes Yorgos Lanthimos’s Poor Things starring Emma Stone, Annie Baker’s directorial debut, as well as Perfect Days, the latest from Wim Wenders.
