The black tank top-wearing woman didn’t sit down, leading to the other woman getting agitated. The two started exchanging some heated words before the Crosby fan escalated things with violence.</p><p>She first knocked the drinks out of the other woman’s hand and started viciously slapping her face multiple times. The Crosby fan then proceeded to throw punches at the other Raiders fan, who tried to hit back with her own punches. But another woman jumped in support of the Crosby fan and started throwing punches at the tank top girl, resulting in an absolutely chaotic situation. Check out the footage of the scuffle attached below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Ultimately, some Raiders fans sitting near them stood up to split the women up and de-escalate the situation.
