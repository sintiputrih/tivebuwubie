Source: NBC / PeacockThe revamped version of Saved by the Bell brings up new questions about issues like systematic inequality or racism, with a daring attitude the original high school comedy series was, arguably, low on. 
Featuring new faces like Josie Totah, Mitchell Hoog, and Haskiri Velazquez, and returning cast members like Elizabeth Berkley and Mario Lopez, the reboot takes a fresh look at what everyday life is like at Bayside High."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A member of the in-crowd, Lexi is often spotted alongside Mac (Mitchell Hoog), the Governor of California and Bayside alum, Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar)'s son.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / Peacock</span></figure><p>Josie came out publicly via an essay published by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Magazine</a> in August 2018, having already built an impressive portfolio as an actress. Following her first breakthrough with a 2012 short film, titled Hip Kids, she went on to appear on TV series like Glee, Jessie, and Champions.&nbsp;</p><p>As she explained in the essay, she first learned about hormone replacement therapy at age 14, while watching a docuseries titled I Am Jazz with her mother. She immediately knew that she wanted to do the same thing, and with her mother's help, she had her first medical appointment within days.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / Peacock</span></figure><p>As Josie revealed in the essay, not every part of the transition was easy. For a while, she struggled with severe anxiety and self-doubt. &nbsp;</p><p>"Like many trans people, I developed serious anxiety as I hid who I was. In some ways, I felt like I was lying by letting people believe I was that gay boy. I also couldn’t be myself," she wrote.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">As a producer of 'Saved by the Bell,' Josie had more of a say in her character's narrative arc.</h2><p>The difficulties that Josie faced are pushed to the background of Saved by the Bell, one of the few shows that don't treat being transgender as a definitive trait of one's identity.&nbsp;</p><p>"Getting to play a role that’s dynamic and interesting and more than what people think about on the outside is such a gift as an actor," Josie told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teen Vogue</a>.</p><p>"[Lexi is] this mean, fun, aspirational, fantastical character that also happens to be transgender — but it [isn't] everything about her. That was really important to me and the people that I talked to in the trans community because so much of the trans representation in [media] has to do with struggle ..." she added.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC / Peacock</span></figure><p>" ... and that's only when it's done in favor of trans people, [most] of the time [the media] perpetuates the negative stigmas and stereotypes that create the erasure of trans people in our world," she went on to say.&nbsp;</p><p>As a producer, Josie had a say in her character's narrative arc. Working in close collaboration with showrunner Tracey Wigfield, she hoped to create a cheerleader who relishes in drama and is gifted with the ability to coin some snappy comebacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Saved by the Bell is available on&nbsp;Peacock now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK63scNmmbJlpJ2ybq7EpaNmop%2BotqZ506irmqA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
