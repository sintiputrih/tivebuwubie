Some have even thought that she would get with either of the leading men- Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) or Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley), but they were more like brothers to her.</p><p><a href=#>So, did Watson and Felton ever date</a> and did their feelings progress as they got older?

Felton played Draco- the bad, troubled boy from Slytherin, who did have some redeeming qualities in him. Despite Gryffindors and Slytherins being enemies, the two actually became friends on set. Although their characters didn't get that much screen time together, when they did, it was pure magic.</p><h2 id=tutoring-on-set-and-love-at-first-sight><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tutoring On Set And Love At First Sight</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During the reunion special, Emma Watson recalled a time that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all of the kids had to go in for tutoring</a>. "I walked into the room where we were having tutoring. The assignment that had been given was to draw what you thought God looked like, and Tom had drawn a girl with a backward cap on a skateboard. And I just don’t know how to say it — I just fell in love with him. I used to come in every day and look for his number on the call sheet, it was number seven, and if his name was on the call sheet, it was an extra exciting day. He was three years above me and so for him he was like, ‘You’re like my little sister,'" she said.</p><h2 id=tom-felton-was-aware-of-emma-watson-39-s-feelings><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Tom Felton Was Aware Of Emma Watson's Feelings</span></h2><p>Another thing fans will learn from the reunion special is that Felton was aware of Watson's feelings, and he automatically became protective over her. “I think I was in the hair and make-up chair, and someone said something along the lines of, ‘Yeah, she had a crush on you,' I became very protective over her. Yeah, I’ve always had a soft spot for her and that continues to this day. There’s always been something that’s like, I don’t know, a kinship," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Wizarding World Movie Made The Most At The Box Office, And How Much Will 'The Secrets Of Dumbledore' Make?</a></span></p><h2 id=birthday-tributes-and-social-media-posts><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Birthday Tributes And Social Media Posts</span></h2><p>Over the years, the former co-stars have been no strangers to posting about each other on social media, whether it was to wish the other a happy birthday, a casual hang out, or an accomplishment they are proud of.

"There was always something. There was a little bit of a spark," he said, but he did want to start any rumors. He added, "But we were kids. It was like any kind of playground romance."

Or Are They?</span></h2><p>In an interview with Entertainment Tonight in June 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Felton was asked about the possibility of a romance between them</a>. His response? "We are something, if that makes any sense, we've been very close for a long time. And I adore her, I think she's fantastic. Hopefully, she returns the compliment. But as far as the romantic side of it, I think that's a Slytherin-Gryffindor thing rather than a Tom and Emma thing."
